    "Block-based indexing is a technique used to handle large datasets that cannot fit into memory all at once. The idea is to divide the data into smaller, manageable blocks, process each block individually, and then write the results to disk. This allows you to work with large datasets without running into memory limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple breakdown:\n",
    "- Divide the Data: Split the data into smaller blocks that can fit into memory.\n",
    "- Process Each Block: Process each block individually (e.g., create an inverted index).\n",
    "- Write to Disk: Write the processed blocks to disk.\n",
    "- Merge: After processing all blocks, merge the results to create the final index."
