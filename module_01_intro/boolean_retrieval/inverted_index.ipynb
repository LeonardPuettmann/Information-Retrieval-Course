      "But many copies contain the true account (as an alternative), derived no doubt from notes by Frodo or Samwise, both of whom learned the truth, though they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old hobbit himself.\n",

      "That also Gandalf thought strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth in this point for many more years, as will be seen in this book.\n",

'\n",

      "From the time of Gandalf's arrival he remained hidden from view.\n",
      "The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but designed and made by him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him.\n",
      "The art of Gandalf improved with age.\n",
      "And there was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended.\n",
      "The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf).\n",
      "They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card, written in golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to refuse.\n",

      "At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in.\n",
      "'I am old, Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him.\n",
      "I want to see mountains again, Gandalf, _mountains,_ and then find somewhere where I can _rest._ In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell.\n",
      "'_\n",
      "     Gandalf laughed.\n",
      "Frodo has read some already, as far as it has gone.\n",
      "You'll keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?'\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his eyes.\n",
      "'No, but I had to badger you,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Yes, yes,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf stood up.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf's eyes flashed.\n",
      "Then you will see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked.'\n",
      "Gandalf's eyes remained bent on the hobbit.\n",
      "'I don't know what has come over you, Gandalf,' he said.\n",
      "'I have never called you one,' Gandalf answered.\n",
      "'Then trust mine,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Give it to Frodo, and I will look after him.'\n",
      "'Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Very well,' said Bilbo, 'it goes to Frodo with all the rest.'\n",
      "'No, don't give the ring to me,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes.\n",
      "'Good-bye, Gandalf!'\n",
      "Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness.\n",
      "Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep in thought.\n",
      "'Yes,' answered Gandalf, 'he has gone at last.'\n",
      "' I wish – I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,' said Frodo.\n",
      "I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but did not open it.\n",
      "exclaimed Frodo.\n",
      "'It may, and it may not,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to the guests.\n",
      "Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field, but Frodo would only say _no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning_.\n",
      "Frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired and worried.\n",
      "Dora was Drogo's sister and the eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine, and had written reams of good advice for more than half a century.\n",
      "There was plenty of everything left for Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon.\n",
      "Frodo had retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye on things.\n",
      "When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.\n",
      "Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of him.\n",
      "When Frodo replied that only the things specially directed by Bilbo were being given away, they said the whole affair was very fishy.\n",
      "Otho would have been Bilbo's heir, but for the adoption of Frodo.\n",
      "He snapped his fingers under Frodo's nose and slumped off.\n",
      "A little later Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the place, investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors.\n",
      "That was an insult, if you like,' said Frodo as he shut the door on her.\n",
      "Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot's grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo.\n",
      "When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out, Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall.\n",
      "'If you don't let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down your hole and out through the hill,' he said.\n",
      "'My dear Gandalf!\n",
      "cried Frodo, running out of the room to the door.\n",
      "said Gandalf, sitting down.\n",
      "'Do be careful of that ring, Frodo!\n",
      "'Which story, I wonder,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,' said Frodo.\n",
      "\"No secrets between us, Frodo,\" he said; \"but they are not to go any further.\n",
      "'That's interesting,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'I don't understand,' said Frodo.\n",
      "cried Frodo.\n",
      "exclaimed Frodo.\n",
      "'So do I,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo saw him to the door.\n",
      "He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked off at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent, almost as if he was carrying a great weight.\n",
      "Frodo did not see him again for a long time.\n",
      "The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf.\n",
      "'If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps he'll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,' they said.\n",
      "And to all appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable.\n",
      "Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving Bilbo's Birthday Party year after year until they got used to it.\n",
      "Frodo went tramping all over the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight.\n",
      "As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good 'preservation': outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens.\n",
      "'Some folk have all the luck,' they said; but it was not until Frodo approached the usually more sober age of fifty that they began to think it queer.\n",
      "Frodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his own master and _the_ Mr. Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant.\n",
      "Frodo began to feel restless, and the old paths seemed too well-trodden.\n",
      "     There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could.\n",
      "But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries, seeking refuge in the West.\n",
      "     It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence.\n",
      "Then he paid Frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he went off again.\n",
      "He would not discuss his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo's health and doings.\n",
      "It was over nine years since Frodo had seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits.\n",
      "Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'You look the same as ever, Frodo!'\n",
      "'So do you,' Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked older and more careworn.\n",
      "     Next morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with Frodo by the open window of the study.\n",
      "Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief.\n",
      "He was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep in thought.\n",
      "Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought.\n",
      "'Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring, Gandalf,' he said.\n",
      "'A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die, but he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues, until at last every minute is a weariness.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "asked Frodo at length.\n",
      "'Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,' said Frodo, 'so I have always kept it on its chain.'\n",
      "'Very wise,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "asked Frodo again.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'I have known much that only the Wise know, Frodo.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "'Maybe not,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "asked Frodo anxiously.\n",
      "'He felt better at once,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo shuddered.\n",
      "'To tell you the truth,' replied Gandalf, 'I believe that hitherto – _hitherto,_mark you – he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "'It has everything to do with it,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "     'I cannot read the fiery letters,' said Frodo in a quavering voice.\n",
      "'No,' said Gandalf, 'but I can.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times.\n",
      "And already, Frodo, our time is beginning to look black.\n",
      "'And this is the dreadful chance, Frodo.\n",
      "cried Frodo.\n",
      "'It was taken from him,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf paused.\n",
      "cried Frodo.\n",
      "'I can't believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, however distantly,' said Frodo with some heat.\n",
      "'It is true all the same,' replied Gandalf.\n",
      "'Yes,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'Only too true, I fear,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf sighed.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "'You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'A Ring of Power looks after itself, Frodo.\n",
      "It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the Ring itself that decided things.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "'It is no laughing matter,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'There was more than one power at work, Frodo.\n",
      "It is not,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Gandalf looked at Frodo, and his eyes glinted.\n",
      "asked Frodo, interrupting.\n",
      "exclaimed Frodo in amazement.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "'I saw him there,' answered Gandalf, 'but before that he had wandered far, following Bilbo's trail.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "'Ah,' said Gandalf, 'now we come to it.\n",
      "Yes, Frodo, and not the first; though I fear it may prove the worst.\n",
      "Frodo could hear his heart beating.\n",
      "'Yes, to Mordor,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Indeed, Frodo, I fear that he may even think that the long-unnoticed name of _Baggins_ has become important.'\n",
      "cried Frodo.\n",
      "O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I to do?\n",
      "And he has been well rewarded, Frodo.\n",
      "'I am sorry,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'You have not seen him,' Gandalf broke in.\n",
      "'No, and I don't want to,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'All the same,' said Frodo, 'even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, I wish he had not kept the Ring.\n",
      "'Of course, my dear Frodo, it was dangerous for you; and that has troubled me deeply.\n",
      "cried Frodo again.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it.\n",
      "The gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was its colour, how perfect was its roundness.\n",
      "He weighed the Ring in his hand, hesitating, and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him; and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away – but he found that he had put it back in his pocket.\n",
      "Gandalf laughed grimly.\n",
      "Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily let it go, nor will to damage it.\n",
      "cried Frodo.\n",
      "'Such questions cannot be answered,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "cried Gandalf, springing to his feet.\n",
      "'And now,' said the wizard, turning back to Frodo, 'the decision lies with you.\n",
      "He laid his hand on Frodo's shoulder.\n",
      "Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe, as if lost in thought.\n",
      "His eyes seemed closed, but under the lids he was watching Frodo intently.\n",
      "Frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth, until they filled all his vision, and he seemed to be looking down into profound wells of fire.\n",
      "said Gandalf at last.\n",
      "answered Frodo, coming back to himself out of darkness, and finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the window he could see the sunlit garden.\n",
      "'Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with that purpose,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'I hope so,' said Frodo.\n",
      "He did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart – to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps to find him again.\n",
      "'My dear Frodo!'\n",
      "exclaimed Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo became aware that all was very quiet, inside and outside.\n",
      "Gandalf crept to one side of the window.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!'\n",
      "'I don't,' said Gandalf grimly.\n",
      "Gandalf's eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles.\n",
      "Frodo, sir!'\n",
      "'He won't hurt you,' said Frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing, although he was himself startled and rather puzzled.\n",
      "Suddenly Gandalf laughed.\n",
      "'So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away?'\n",
      "'It can't be helped, Sam,' said Frodo sadly.\n",
      "If you don't, if you even breathe a word of what you've heard here, then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes.'\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo!'\n",
      "     'You ought to go quietly, and you ought to go soon,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Two or three weeks had passed, and still Frodo made no sign of getting ready to go.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "But he did not tell all his thoughts to Gandalf.\n",
      "He looked at Frodo and smiled.\n",
      "'As for _where I_ am going,' said Frodo, 'it would be difficult to give that away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.'\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'I have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving Bag End, and of saying farewell, that I have never even considered the direction,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'But you cannot see very far,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "He spoke lightly; but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the house of Elrond Halfelven, and breathe the air of that deep valley where many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace.\n",
      "     One summer's evening an astonishing piece of news reached the _Ivy Bush_ and _Green Dragon._ Giants and other portents on the borders of the Shire were forgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodo was selling Bag End, indeed he had already sold it – to the Sackville-Bagginses!\n",
      "Just why Mr. Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more debatable than the price.\n",
      "A few held the theory – supported by the nods and hints of Mr. Baggins himself – that Frodo's money was running out: he was going to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale down in Buckland among his Brandybuck relations.\n",
      "But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of Bag End become that most found this hard to believe, harder than any other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by Gandalf.\n",
      "But however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry, there was no doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland.\n",
      "Gandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months.\n",
      "Then one evening, at the end of June, soon after Frodo's plan had been finally arranged, he suddenly announced that he was going off again next morning.\n",
      "He spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather worried.\n",
      "At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered often what Gandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while.\n",
      "Autumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about Gandalf again.\n",
      "Some of Frodo's friends came to stay and help him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin, and of course his special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck.\n",
      "On September 20th two covered carts went off laden to Buckland, conveying the furniture and goods that Frodo had not sold to his new home, by way of the Brandywine Bridge.\n",
      "The next day Frodo became really anxious, and kept a constant look-out for Gandalf.\n",
      "Still Gandalf did not appear.\n",
      "In the evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was quite small, just a dinner for himself and his four helpers; but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it.\n",
      "The four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf's absence.\n",
      "The dining-room was bare except for a table and chairs, but the food was good, and there was good wine: Frodo's wine had not been included in the sale to the Sackville-Bagginses.\n",
      "said Frodo, as he drained his glass.\n",
      "When they had sung many songs, and talked of many things they had done together, they toasted Bilbo's birthday, and they drank his health and Frodo's together according to Frodo's custom.\n",
      "Frodo's party was over, and Gandalf had not come.\n",
      "Frodo was restless and anxious, listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf.\n",
      "After that, if Gandalf wanted him urgently, he would go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first.\n",
      "For Frodo was going on foot.\n",
      "After lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-haired son, Lotho, turned up, much to Frodo's annoyance.\n",
      "Frodo did not offer her any tea.\n",
      "It had been officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland 'to do for Mr. Frodo and look after his bit of garden'; an arrangement that was approved by the Gaffer, though it did not console him for the prospect of having Lobelia as a neighbour.\n",
      "said Frodo, pushing back his chair.\n",
      "Frodo wandered round the familiar rooms, and saw the light of the sunset fade on the walls, and shadows creep out of the corners.\n",
      "He half expected to see Gandalf come striding up through the dusk.\n",
      "I am going to start, and Gandalf must follow me.'\n",
      "Frodo wondered vaguely why the fact that they did not come on up the Hill seemed a great relief.\n",
      "Frodo stepped inside the dark door.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo shut and locked the round door, and gave the key to Sam.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo, looking at the dark blank windows.\n",
      "'I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,' said Frodo.\n",
      "laughed Frodo.\n",
      "When the light of the last farm was far behind, peeping among the trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell.\n",
      "'I thought you liked walking in the dark,' said Frodo.\n",
      "They set no watch; even Frodo feared no danger yet, for they were still in the heart of the Shire.\n",
      "Frodo woke up first, and found that a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff.\n",
      "Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over, and then walked off to the edge of the wood.\n",
      "'I don't keep water in my pockets,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'You can come too,' said Frodo, 'and bring all the water-bottles.'\n",
      "Frodo was silent.\n",
      "'I don't know,' said Frodo.\n",
      "\"It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out of your door,\" he used to say.\n",
      "'I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,' said Frodo; but even as he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him.\n",
      "And if it is Gandalf,' he added as an afterthought, 'we can give him a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late.\n",
      "Frodo hesitated for a second: curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide.\n",
      "When it reached the tree and was level with Frodo the horse stopped.\n",
      "A sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo, and he thought of his Ring.\n",
      "The advice of Gandalf seemed absurd.\n",
      "Frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider, until he dwindled into the distance.\n",
      "'Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,' said Frodo to himself, as he walked towards his companions.\n",
      "Pippin and Sam had remained flat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo described the rider and his strange behaviour.\n",
      "'There are some Men about,' said Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment.\n",
      "_I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning.\n",
      "'The Gaffer can't be blamed anyway,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'I wish I had waited for Gandalf,' Frodo muttered.\n",
      "'I don't know, and I would rather not guess,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'All right, cousin Frodo!\n",
      "'Yes, I think we will move on now,' said Frodo; 'but not on the road -in case that rider comes back, or another follows him.\n",
      "'That is the way for us,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Bilbo Baggins had made the words, to a tune that was as old as the hills, and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of the Water-valley and talked about Adventure.\n",
      "Frodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsiness stole over them.\n",
      "'It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was chiefly on the words spoken.\n",
      "When Pippin had gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo's feet, where at last he nodded and closed his eyes.\n",
      "Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor.\n",
      "They spoke of many things, old and new, and Frodo questioned Gildor much about happenings in the wide world outside the Shire.\n",
      "At last Frodo asked the question that was nearest to his heart:\n",
      "     'Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?'\n",
      "He would say no more about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent.\n",
      "'You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,' said Gildor.\n",
      "'It is,' said Frodo; 'but I thought my going was a secret known only to Gandalf and my faithful Sam.'\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "'Has Gandalf told you nothing?'\n",
      "'I cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your hints and warnings,' exclaimed Frodo.\n",
      "But if you desire clearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf.\n",
      "These things Gandalf must know.\n",
      "I have been expecting Gandalf for many days.\n",
      "'That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well.\n",
      "'And it is also said,' answered Frodo: 'Go _not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes.\n",
      "I think you should now go at once, without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go alone.\n",
      "'I am deeply grateful,' said Frodo; 'but I wish you would tell me plainly what the Black Riders are.\n",
      "If I take your advice I may not see Gandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the danger that pursues me.'\n",
      "But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you, Frodo son of Drogo, will know more of these fell things than Gildor Inglorion.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor finished speaking.\n",
      "     In the morning Frodo woke refreshed.\n",
      "Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat.\n",
      "'To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,' answered Frodo, and gave his attention to the food.\n",
      "'Yes, probably,' said Frodo, not liking the reminder.\n",
      "'Not much – only hints and riddles,' said Frodo evasively.\n",
      "'We didn't discuss it,' said Frodo with his mouth full.\n",
      "'In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain it,' said Frodo sharply.\n",
      "From Frodo's mind the bright morning – treacherously bright, he thought – had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor.\n",
      "'They are,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him.\n",
      "But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion.\n",
      "Frodo finished his breakfast in silence.\n",
      "'We can cut straighter than the road anyway,' answered Frodo.\n",
      "'It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,' answered Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "'I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam (in spite of private misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing).\n",
      "Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line.\n",
      "he said, clutching Frodo by the arm.\n",
      "Frodo led the way, and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream.\n",
      "'It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "     There was a terrific splash, and a shout of _Whoa!_ from Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo came out drying his hair.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "A fact which partly explains young Frodo's long expeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish, and the wrath of the injured Maggot.\n",
      "'We have all been scared,' said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo stared at the fire and did not speak.\n",
      "'If Frodo won't talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.'\n",
      "Frodo remained silent.\n",
      "What do you make of it all, Frodo?'\n",
      "'Cousin Frodo has been very close,' said Pippin.\n",
      "'That was only a guess,' said Frodo hastily.\n",
      "But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think his guess good or bad.'\n",
      "'I _think,'_ answered Frodo slowly, 'that it was a good guess, as far as it goes.\n",
      "said Frodo at last, sitting up and straightening his back, as if he had made a decision.\n",
      "said Frodo, looking at him anxiously.\n",
      "'Just this, my dear old Frodo: you are miserable, because you don't know how to say good-bye.\n",
      "Frodo opened his mouth and shut it again.\n",
      "'Dear old Frodo!'\n",
      "And all those close talks with Gandalf.'\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "I don't know what Gandalf would say.\n",
      "'But I must go,' said Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo deeply moved.\n",
      "said Frodo, now completely amazed.\n",
      "said Frodo faintly.\n",
      "I must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen the old fellow's secret book.'\n",
      "cried Frodo.\n",
      "Have you got it, Frodo?'\n",
      "You are not a very easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is worse.\n",
      "said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard.\n",
      "cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go no further, and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved, or merely foolish.\n",
      "But I meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf for that matter.\n",
      "'_\n",
      "     'But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,' said Frodo.\n",
      "We are your friends, Frodo.\n",
      "We know most of what Gandalf has told you.\n",
      "'I don't deny it,' said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning.\n",
      "Three cheers for Captain Frodo and company!'\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "'I don't know,' answered Frodo.\n",
      "But I should very much like to see Gandalf.\n",
      "I could see that even Gildor was disturbed when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared.\n",
      "'It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?'\n",
      "Frodo sat for a while in thought.\n",
      "It sounds very desperate, but I believe Frodo is right.\n",
      "Frodo went in once, long ago.\n",
      "Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.'\n",
      "Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, nor to see what lay outside it.\n",
      "He had even brought along some old clothes of Frodo's to help him in playing the part.\n",
      "said Frodo, when he understood the plan.\n",
      "'We could not have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise.\n",
      "But if Fatty is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we have gone, that decides me.\n",
      "When at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time.\n",
      "     Frodo woke suddenly.\n",
      "said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered.\n",
      "'Good-bye, Frodo!'\n",
      "'If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest, I shall be lucky,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road: we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.'\n",
      "'You had better lead on and find that path,' Frodo said to him.\n",
      "Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, and if he had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood.\n",
      "Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them, but his voice sank to a murmur.\n",
      "     He fell silent again; but Frodo could not help asking one more question: the one he most desired to have answered.\n",
      "In the dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light.\n",
      "It seemed to Frodo that he was lifted up, and passing over he saw that the rock-wall was a circle of hills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone, like a vast tower but not made by hands.\n",
      "thought Frodo as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs still echoing in his mind.\n",
      "Frodo ran to the eastern window, and found himself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew.\n",
      "The hobbits listened with delight; and Frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed the kindly weather, because it delayed them from departing.\n",
      "Frodo stood near the open door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and go bubbling away down into the valley.\n",
      "Moving constantly in and out of his talk was Old Man Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed more than enough, for it was not comfortable lore.\n",
      "Whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed Frodo could not tell.\n",
      "It was also clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that in some fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo.\n",
      "Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had told before even to Gandalf.\n",
      "he said suddenly in the midst of the story: and Frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the chain from his pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom.\n",
      "Frodo gave a cry – and Tom leaned forward and handed it back to him with a smile.\n",
      "Frodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one who has lent a trinket to a juggler).\n",
      "It was the same Ring, or looked the same and weighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand.\n",
      "He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilously important.\n",
      "Frodo was delighted (in a way): it was his own ring all right, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair, and obviously could not see him.\n",
      "Come Frodo, there!\n",
      "Frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the Ring he came and sat down again.\n",
      "But either in his dreams or out of them, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind; a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver, until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise.\n",
      "They had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped.\n",
      "And to Frodo she said: 'Farewell, Elf-friend, it was a merry meeting!'\n",
      "But Frodo found no words to answer.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "To prevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading.\n",
      "Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign.\n",
      "Frodo!\n",
      "'Frodo!\n",
      "said Frodo; but he did not run away.\n",
      "Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire.\n",
      "Frodo was chilled to the marrow.\n",
      "At first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the incantation.\n",
      "Gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do.\n",
      "Frodo fell forward over Merry, and Merry's face felt cold.\n",
      "     It was dark, and white stars were shining, when Frodo and his companions came at last to the Greenway-crossing and drew near the village.\n",
      "'We are making for the inn here,' answered Frodo.\n",
      "'Our names and our business are our own, and this does not seem a good place to discuss them,' said Frodo, not liking the look of the man or the tone of his voice.\n",
      "He wished them good night, and they said no more; but Frodo could see in the lantern-light that the man was still eyeing them curiously.\n",
      "Could it have been Gandalf?\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat man with a bald head and a red face.\n",
      "'Can we-' began Frodo.\n",
      "Took and Mr. Brandybuck,' said Frodo; 'and this is Sam Gamgee.\n",
      "So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper (about three quarters of an hour's steady going, not hindered by unnecessary talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join the company.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo, unwisely interrupting.\n",
      "asked Frodo eagerly.\n",
      "That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean.\n",
      "said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow unravelling of Butterbur's thoughts.\n",
      "Old Gandalf.\n",
      "     'A letter for me from Gandalf!'\n",
      "cried Frodo.\n",
      "'It is,' said Frodo, 'and you had better give me that letter at once, and explain why you never sent it.\n",
      "And I'm mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say, if harm comes of it.\n",
      "'Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "'He's here with my leave,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'I'm sorry I can't explain it all,' answered Frodo.\n",
      "'It is,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'Well, we can only hope the Riders won't come back yet,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'In any case we must be called at dawn,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'I don't know,' said Frodo with sudden anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Frodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to Pippin and Sam.\n",
      "But what can have happened to Gandalf?\n",
      "Frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf's second postscript.\n",
      "'Why didn't you tell me that you were Gandalf's friend at once?'\n",
      "'They are – at first sight at any rate,' laughed Pippin with sudden relief after reading Gandalf's letter.\n",
      "'How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about?'\n",
      "'You never mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out.\n",
      "At last Frodo spoke with hesitation.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "But how did you know that they were in Gandalf's letter, if you have never seen it?'\n",
      "Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us.\n",
      "'When did you last see Gandalf?'\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "The tidings had gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen.\n",
      "'Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it – with Gandalf's absence, I mean?'\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know – as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys.\n",
      "They stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped: 'I have seen them, Frodo!\n",
      "cried Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "'This is a friend of Gandalf's.\n",
      "'We seem to have enemies all round,' said Frodo.\n",
      "While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that had happened since supper.\n",
      "Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalf's letter when Strider and Nob returned.\n",
      "Peering out, Frodo saw that the night was still clear.\n",
      "'Very ridiculous of you, Frodo!\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "'But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there?'\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "If Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him.\n",
      "After half an hour's plodding climb Strider reached the crown of the hill; Frodo and Merry followed, tired and breathless.\n",
      "And no sign of Gandalf.\n",
      "On the flat under-side Frodo saw some scratches:  'There seems to he a stroke, a dot, and three more strokes,' he said.\n",
      "'It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure.\n",
      "'What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?'\n",
      "asked Merry\n",
      "     'I should say,' answered Strider, 'that they stood for G3, and were a sign that Gandalf was here on October the third: that is three days ago now.\n",
      "'I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks, whatever they may mean,' said Frodo 'It would be a great comfort to know that he was on the way, in front of us or behind us.'\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "In that lonely place Frodo for the first time fully realized his homelessness and danger.\n",
      "At once Strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle, pulling Frodo down beside him.\n",
      "They could all see the black specks, but neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain; yet something told them that there, far below, were Black Riders assembling on the Road beyond the foot of the hill.\n",
      "'I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,' he said to Pippin.\n",
      "'I was very anxious to find some sign of Gandalf; but it was a mistake for three of us to go up and stand there so long.\n",
      "said Frodo, looking round wildly.\n",
      "'I don't see how our food can be made to last,' said Frodo.\n",
      "So tighten your belts, and think with hope of the tables of Elrond's house!'\n",
      "Frodo and his companions huddled round the fire, wrapped in every garment and blanket they possessed; but Strider was content with a single cloak, and sat a little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe.\n",
      "'So also does Frodo, for it concerns us closely.'\n",
      "Merry and Pippin looked at Frodo, who was staring into the fire.\n",
      "'I know only the little that Gandalf has told me,' said Frodo slowly.\n",
      "If we win through to the house of Elrond, you may hear it there, told in full.'\n",
      "'I will tell you the tale of Tinúviel,' said Strider, 'in brief – for it is a long tale of which the end is not known; and there are none now, except Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old.\n",
      "Elrond of Rivendell is of that Kin.\n",
      "Frodo and Pippin remained seated in silence.\n",
      "All seemed quiet and still, but Frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart, now that Strider was no longer speaking.\n",
      "asked Frodo, springing to his feet.\n",
      "Frodo stirred, feeling that he must break the silence: he longed to shout out aloud.\n",
      "Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill.\n",
      "Sam shrank to Frodo's side.\n",
      "Frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions; he was quaking as if he was bitter cold, but his terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the Ring.\n",
      "He did not forget the Barrow, nor the message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to yield.\n",
      "He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo.\n",
      "At that moment Frodo threw himself forward on the ground, and he heard himself crying aloud: O _Elbereth!\n",
      "With a last effort Frodo, dropping his sword, slipped the Ring from his finger and closed his right hand tight upon it.\n",
      "     When Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the Ring desperately.\n",
      "He heard Frodo's voice, but it seemed to come from a great distance, or from under the earth, crying out strange words.\n",
      "They saw nothing more, until they stumbled over the body of Frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards on the grass with his sword beneath him.\n",
      "They started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo; but Strider knelt down swiftly at his side.\n",
      "When he heard what Frodo had to tell, he became full of concern, and shook his head and sighed.\n",
      "'Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!'\n",
      "Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so.\n",
      "Frodo dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side.\n",
      "'This was the stroke of Frodo's sword,' he said.\n",
      "'And more deadly to Frodo was this!'\n",
      "Then setting it aside, he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch.\n",
      "He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo's shoulder.\n",
      "The herb had also some power over the wound, for Frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side; but the life did not return to his arm, and he could not raise or use his hand.\n",
      "If Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not return.\n",
      "It was impossible for Frodo to walk, so they divided the greater part of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo on the pony.\n",
      "And they needed fuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm, especially at night, while fire would be some protection for them all.\n",
      "Frodo's heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down, and their backs bowed under their burdens.\n",
      "Before the first day's march was over Frodo's pain began to grow again, but he did not speak of it for a long time.\n",
      "Frodo, who was not walking, had time to gaze ahead and to think.\n",
      "Frodo guessed that they were now in the same region, and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "There my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in peace, even in the fair house of Elrond.'\n",
      "As long as they could they avoided climbing for Frodo's sake, and because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales.\n",
      "Frodo was restless.\n",
      "Before long Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot.\n",
      "Frodo threw himself down, and lay on the ground shivering.\n",
      "'I am afraid this has been too much for Frodo.\n",
      "'Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,' said Strider, 'and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive out.\n",
      "Frodo lay half in a dream, imagining that endless dark wings were sweeping by above him, and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hills.\n",
      "They climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge; but the way was much easier than they had expected, for the slope was far less steep on this side, and before long Frodo was able to ride again.\n",
      "Even Frodo felt better in the morning light, but every now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight, and he passed his hands over his eyes.\n",
      "Sam and Strider came behind, one on each side of Frodo's pony, for the path was now broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast.\n",
      "Frodo said nothing, but Sam looked scared.\n",
      "There was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits, and then even Frodo laughed.\n",
      "These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf, quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.'\n",
      "Bilbo and Frodo had told it often; but as a matter of fact he had never more than half believed it.\n",
      "Frodo felt his spirits reviving: the reminder of Bilbo's first successful adventure was heartening.\n",
      "'Not since Weathertop,' said Frodo.\n",
      "They were probably following the very track that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves had used many years before.\n",
      "How much is left of Bilbo's share, I wonder, Frodo?'\n",
      "Frodo looked at the stone, and wished that Bilbo had brought home no treasure more perilous, nor less easy to pan with.\n",
      "said Frodo, listening intently.\n",
      "To Frodo it appeared that a white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil.\n",
      "'This is Glorfindel, who dwells in the house of Elrond,' said Strider.\n",
      "said the Elf-lord to Frodo.\n",
      "'Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?'\n",
      "cried Frodo joyfully.\n",
      "'Elrond received news that troubled him.\n",
      "They said that the Nine were abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance, for Gandalf had not returned.\n",
      "There are few even in Rivendell that can ride openly against the Nine; but such as there were, Elrond sent out north, west, and south.\n",
      "Frodo felt a great weariness come over him.\n",
      "Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety.\n",
      "Keep it, Aragorn, till we reach the house of Elrond!\n",
      "He searched the wound on Frodo's shoulder with his fingers, and his face grew graver, as if what he learned disquieted him.\n",
      "But Frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "It is you, Frodo, and that which you bear that brings us all in peril.'\n",
      "     Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed.\n",
      "'In the House of Elrond, and it is ten o'clock in the morning.'\n",
      "`Gandalf!'\n",
      "cried Frodo, sitting up.\n",
      "Frodo lay down again.\n",
      "While he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft puffs of Gandalf's pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out of the window.\n",
      "Frodo asked at length.\n",
      "'Yes, they are all safe and sound,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "You were beginning to fade,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "'You seem to know a great deal already,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo,' said Gandalf gently, 'and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory.\n",
      "'We should never have done it without Strider,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'I was delayed,' said Gandalf, `and that nearly proved our ruin.\n",
      "You are not supposed to talk or worry about anything today, by Elrond's orders.'\n",
      "`But talking would stop me thinking and wondering, which are quite as tiring,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'You will soon hear all you wish to know,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "cried Frodo.\n",
      "'Yes, I, Gandalf the Grey,' said the wizard solemnly.\n",
      "'Yes,' said Frodo, `it was Strider that saved us.\n",
      "Gandalf smiled.\n",
      "'I am glad,' said Frodo.\n",
      "`You don't know much even about them, if you think old Barliman is stupid,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Frodo in wonder.\n",
      "cried Gandalf.\n",
      "`My dear Frodo, that is just what the Rangers are: the last remnant in the North of the great people, the Men of the West.\n",
      "'I suppose not,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo answered.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were brought in.'\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "Elrond is a master of healing, but the weapons of our Enemy are deadly.\n",
      "Then Elrond removed a splinter.\n",
      "Frodo shuddered, remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that had vanished in Strider's hands.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo faintly.\n",
      "'Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,' said Gandalf, `not to mention courage.\n",
      "`I know,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'I haven't any courage to keep up,' said Frodo, `but I am not worried at the moment.\n",
      "Gandalf moved his chair to the bedside, and took a good look at Frodo.\n",
      "`Still that must be expected,' said Gandalf to himself.\n",
      "`He is not half through yet, and to what he will come in the end not even Elrond can foretell.\n",
      "`I will risk a brief tale without consulting Elrond.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "'No,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Elrond's folk met them, carrying you slowly towards Rivendell.'\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "'Elrond commanded it,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "`Yes, it all comes back to me now,' said Frodo: 'the tremendous roaring.\n",
      "Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo, but he had shut his eyes.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "`It is wonderful that Elrond, and Glorfindel and such great lords, not to mention Strider, should take so much trouble and show me so much kindness.'\n",
      "`Well, there are many reasons why they should,' said Gandalf, smiling.\n",
      "said Frodo sleepily.\n",
      "     Frodo was now safe in the Last Homely House east of the Sea.\n",
      "As the evening drew on, Frodo woke up again, and he found that he no longer felt in need of rest or sleep, but had a mind for food and drink, and probably for singing and story-telling afterwards.\n",
      "He ran to Frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly and shyly.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "`Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo.\n",
      "Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were ready to come down, and I thought he was joking.'\n",
      "'I am ready,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'I know what you have been doing, Sam,' said Frodo, taking his arm.\n",
      "The sound of running and falling water was loud, and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers, as if summer still lingered in Elrond's gardens.\n",
      "Make way for Frodo, Lord of the Ring!'\n",
      "said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch.\n",
      "The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of Mordor, whose power is again stretching out over the world!\n",
      "`Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,' said Pippin.\n",
      "`I feel like singing myself,' laughed Frodo.\n",
      "`As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered, the preparations began.'\n",
      "     The hall of Elrond's house was filled with folk: Elves for the most part, though there were a few guests of other sorts.\n",
      "Elrond, as was his custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left, Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were revealed as lords of dignity and power.\n",
      "Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend.\n",
      "The face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful.\n",
      "In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, and so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one of his close kindred.\n",
      "So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of Lúthien had come on earth again; and she was called Undómiel, for she was the Evenstar of her people.\n",
      "Such loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor imagined in his mind; and he was both surprised and abashed to find that he had a seat at Elrond's table among all these folk so high and fair.\n",
      "Frodo could see him now, sitting with Pippin and Merry at the upper end of one of the side-tables close to the dais.\n",
      "Next to Frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance, richly dressed.\n",
      "Frodo stopped eating to look at him.\n",
      "'Frodo Baggins at your service and your family's,' said Frodo correctly, rising in surprise and scattering his cushions.\n",
      "`Quite right,' answered the dwarf, gathering up the cushions and courteously assisting Frodo back into his seat.\n",
      "`Thank you very much,' said Frodo.\n",
      "But perhaps I should not inquire too closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?'\n",
      "'I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,' said Frodo politely.\n",
      "He guessed that even in Elrond's house the matter of the Ring was not one for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time.\n",
      "Master Elrond will summon us all ere long, I believe, and then we shall all hear many things.\n",
      "Throughout the rest of the meal they talked together, but Frodo listened more than he spoke; for the news of the Shire, apart from the Ring, seemed small and far-away and unimportant, while Glóin had much to tell of events in the northern regions of Wilderland.\n",
      "Frodo learned that Grimbeorn the Old, son of Beorn, was now the lord of many sturdy men, and to their land between the Mountains and Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "He was delighted to have found so polite a listener; for Frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject, though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people and places that he had never heard of before.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "Glóin began then to talk of the works of his people, telling Frodo about their great labours in Dale and under the Mountain.\n",
      "You should see the waterways of Dale, Frodo, and the fountains, and the pools!\n",
      "'I will come and see them, if ever I can,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Glóin looked at Frodo and smiled.\n",
      "`Yes,' answered Frodo.\n",
      "Elrond and Arwen rose and went down the hall, and the company followed them in due order.\n",
      "Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf.\n",
      "As Elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him, elvish minstrels began to make sweet music.\n",
      "Slowly the hall filled, and Frodo looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together; the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair.\n",
      "Frodo wondered whether he was ill (if people were ever ill in Rivendell), and had been unable to come to the feast.\n",
      "Elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure.\n",
      "Then, turning to Frodo, he beckoned to him.\n",
      "'Now at last the hour has come that you have wished for, Frodo,' he said.\n",
      "cried Frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward.\n",
      "`Hullo, Frodo my lad!'\n",
      "cried Frodo.\n",
      "he said, cocking an eye at Elrond.\n",
      "There was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness that Frodo could see.\n",
      "Master Elrond.\n",
      "Elrond laughed.\n",
      "In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly and placed himself near them.\n",
      "Gandalf has been here often.\n",
      "It is a pity that Gandalf did not find out more sooner.\n",
      "I have thought several times of going back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they would not let me: Gandalf and Elrond, I mean.\n",
      "'And Gandalf said: \"The Ring has passed on, Bilbo.\n",
      "Odd sort of remark, just like Gandalf.\n",
      "He paused and looked at Frodo doubtfully.\n",
      "`Yes, I've got it,' answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance.\n",
      "When he had dressed, Frodo found that while he slept the Ring had been hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong.\n",
      "But Frodo quickly drew back the Ring.\n",
      "Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo's face and passed his hand across his eyes.\n",
      "     Next day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed and well.\n",
      "On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk.\n",
      "`I feel ready for anything,' answered Frodo.\n",
      "'You may have a chance later,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "`That is the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,' cried Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back to the house; behind them, uninvited and for the moment forgotten, trotted Sam.\n",
      "Gandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the evening before.\n",
      "To Frodo his dangerous flight, and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world outside, already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream; but the faces that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave.\n",
      "Elrond was there, and several others were seated in silence about him.\n",
      "Frodo saw Glorfindel and Glóin; and in a corner alone Strider was sitting, clad in his old travel-worn clothes again.\n",
      "Elrond drew Frodo to a seat by his side, and presented him to the company, saying:\n",
      "     'Here, my friends is the hobbit, Frodo son of Drogo.\n",
      "He then pointed out and named those whom Frodo had not met before.\n",
      "Beside Glorfindel there were several other counsellors of Elrond's household, of whom Erestor was the chief; and with him was Galdor, an Elf from the Grey Havens who had come on an errand from Círdan the Shipwright.\n",
      "He gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder.\n",
      "`Here,' said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, `is Boromir, a man from the South.\n",
      "Of these things Frodo had already heard many rumours; but the tale of Glóin was new to him, and when the dwarf spoke he listened attentively.\n",
      "Also we crave the advice of Elrond.\n",
      "`You have done well to come,' said Elrond.\n",
      "Then all listened while Elrond in his clear voice spoke of Sauron and the Rings of Power, and their forging in the Second Age of the world long ago.\n",
      "A part of his tale was known to some there, but the full tale to none, and many eyes were turned t= Elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the Elven-smiths of Eregion and their friendship with Moria, and their eagerness for knowledge, by which Sauron ensnared them.\n",
      "Then through all the years that followed he traced the Ring; but since that history is elsewhere recounted, even as Elrond himself set it down in his books of lore, it is not here recalled.\n",
      "For it is a long tale, full of deeds great and terrible, and briefly though Elrond spoke, the sun rode up the sky, and the morning was passing ere he ceased.\n",
      "Thereupon Elrond paused a while and sighed.\n",
      "said Frodo, speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment.\n",
      "`But I thought,' he stammered as Elrond turned towards him, 'I thought that the fall of Gil-galad was a long age ago.'\n",
      "'So it was indeed,' answered Elrond gravely.\n",
      "yes,' said Elrond.\n",
      "Give me leave, Master Elrond, said he, first to say more of Gondor; for verily from the land of Gondor I am come.\n",
      "`In this evil hour I have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues to Elrond: a hundred and ten days I have journeyed all alone.\n",
      "The might of Elrond is in wisdom not in weapons, it is said.\n",
      "This only would he say, that Imladris was of old the name among the Elves of a far northern dale, where Elrond the Halfelven dwelt, greatest of lore-masters.\n",
      "Loth was my father to give me leave, and long have I wandered by roads forgotten, seeking the house of Elrond, of which many had heard, but few knew where it lay.'\n",
      "'And here in the house of Elrond more shall be made clear to you' said Aragorn, standing up.\n",
      "He cast his sword upon the table that stood before Elrond, and the blade was in two pieces.\n",
      "`He is Aragorn son of Arathorn,' said Elrond; `and he is descended through many fathers from Isildur Elendil's son of Minas Ithil.\n",
      "cried Frodo in amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected the Ring to be demanded at once.\n",
      "'Bring out the Ring, Frodo!'\n",
      "said Gandalf solemnly.\n",
      "There was a hush, and all turned their eyes on Frodo.\n",
      "said Elrond.\n",
      "Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side.\n",
      "     `Not very good perhaps, but to the point – if you need more beyond the word of Elrond.\n",
      "`I made that up myself,' he whispered to Frodo, `for the Dúnadan, a long time ago when he first told me about himself.\n",
      "`That shall be told,' said Elrond.\n",
      "`I had not named you,' said Elrond smiling.\n",
      "He would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from the Shire, if he had been allowed; but Elrond raised his hand.\n",
      "For the moment it suffices to know that the Ring passed to Frodo, your heir.\n",
      "Then, less willingly than Bilbo, Frodo told of all his dealings with the Ring from the day that it passed into his keeping.\n",
      "`Yes, it made quite a long tale,' answered Frodo.\n",
      "I still want to know a good deal, especially about Gandalf.'\n",
      "`You speak for me also,' he cried, and turning to Elrond he said: `The Wise may have good reason to believe that the halfling's trove is indeed the Great Ring of long debate, unlikely though that may seem to those who know less.\n",
      "`The questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,' said Elrond.\n",
      "But these things it is the part of Gandalf to make clear; and I call upon him last, for it is the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.'\n",
      "`Some, Galdor,' said Gandalf, `would think the tidings of Glóin, and the pursuit of Frodo, proof enough that the halfling's trove is a thing of great worth to the Enemy.\n",
      "`But we were too late, as Elrond foresaw.\n",
      "Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of the Misty Mountains, at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long lain hidden.\n",
      "`We were all at fault,' said Elrond, `and but for your vigilance the Darkness, maybe, would already be upon us.\n",
      "`From the first my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,' said Gandalf, `and I desired to know how this thing came to Gollum, and how long he had possessed it.\n",
      "And since it seemed fit that Isildur's heir should labour to repair Isildur's fault, I went with Gandalf on the long and hopeless search.'\n",
      "Then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland, down even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor.\n",
      "`But in that time also he made this scroll,' said Gandalf; `and that is not remembered in Gondor, it would seem.\n",
      "`However, I wrote a message to Frodo, and trusted to my friend the innkeeper to send it to him.\n",
      "` \"So you have come, Gandalf,\" he said to me gravely; but in his eyes there seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart.\n",
      "\"Have you indeed, Gandalf the _Grey_! \"\n",
      "It has seldom been heard of that Gandalf the Grey sought for aid, one so cunning and so wise, wandering about the lands, and concerning himself in every business, whether it belongs to him or not.\"\n",
      "And here you will stay, Gandalf the Grey, and rest from journeys.\n",
      "\"And listen, Gandalf, my old friend and helper! \"\n",
      "It would be wise, Gandalf.\n",
      "\"And why not, Gandalf? \"\n",
      "Or until it is found in your despite, and the Ruler has time to turn to lighter matters: to devise, say, a fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey.\"\n",
      "I hoped that Frodo had set forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached Rivendell before the deadly pursuit began.\n",
      "cried Frodo.\n",
      "Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him.\n",
      "'It was only a dream' said Frodo, `but it suddenly came back to me.\n",
      "`Then it was late in coming,' said Gandalf, 'as you will see.\n",
      "Gandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spider's treacherous web!\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "Never before had any man mounted him, but I took him and I tamed him, and so speedily he bore me that I reached the Shire when Frodo was on the Barrow-downs, though I set out from Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton.\n",
      "I came to Hobbiton and Frodo had gone; but I had words with old Gamgee.\n",
      "But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton less than a week before, and that a black horseman had come to the Hill the same evening.\n",
      "I came to the house at Crickhollow, and it was broken open and empty; but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had been Frodo's.\n",
      "cried Frodo in alarm.\n",
      "Gandalf laughed.\n",
      "It was impossible to find you, Frodo, in the wilderness, and it would have been folly to try with all the Nine at my heels.\n",
      "`And that, Frodo, is the end of my account.\n",
      "May Elrond and the others forgive the length of it.\n",
      "But such a thing has not happened before, that Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised.\n",
      "At last Elrond spoke again.\n",
      "Of the tales that we have heard this day the tale of Frodo was most strange to me.\n",
      "`He would not have come,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "`No, I should not put it so,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "`No,' said Gandalf, `not willingly.\n",
      "`I have not the strength,' said Elrond; `neither have they.'\n",
      "`But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess,' said Elrond.\n",
      "`Not safe for ever,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'None here can do so,' said Elrond gravely.\n",
      "Frodo, even in that fair house, looking out upon a sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters, felt a dead darkness in his heart.\n",
      "Boromir stirred, and Frodo looked at him.\n",
      "'Alas, no,' said Elrond.\n",
      "`Nor I,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "`Then be comforted,' said Elrond.\n",
      "`Balin will find no ring in Moria,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Elrond.\n",
      "'We know not for certain,' answered Elrond sadly.\n",
      "Of folly I would say, if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me.'\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'At least for a while,' said Elrond.\n",
      "Merry and Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam had crept into the Council, and had been chosen as Frodo's companion.\n",
      "`Instead of throwing him out, and clapping him in chains, Elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek!'\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "said Gandalf, looking in through the window, which was near the ground.\n",
      "Even old Gandalf.\n",
      "`You were wrong,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "If you want to know, the only real eye-openers, as you put it, were you and Frodo; and I was the only one that was not surprised.'\n",
      "`Well, anyway,' said Bilbo, 'nothing was decided beyond choosing poor Frodo and Sam.\n",
      "But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when the reports come in.\n",
      "Have they started yet, Gandalf?'\n",
      "Elrond is sending Elves, and they will get in touch with the Rangers, and maybe with Thranduil's folk in Mirkwood.\n",
      "And Aragorn has gone with Elrond's sons.\n",
      "So cheer up, Frodo!\n",
      "'It's your fault partly, Frodo my lad: insisting on waiting for my birthday.\n",
      "'I am afraid it will,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "In the meantime you should try and forget your troubles, Frodo.\n",
      "So great was Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the window-sill, where he had been sitting, and took off his hat and bowed.\n",
      "In this matter Elrond will have much to say, and your friend the Strider.\n",
      "Which reminds me, I want to see Elrond.\n",
      "said Frodo to Bilbo when Gandalf had gone.\n",
      "'Yes, several, and all are dark and unpleasant,' said Frodo.\n",
      "`It will do well, if it ever comes to that,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo could see it from his window, deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of the valley.\n",
      "The hobbits had been nearly two months in the House of Elrond, and November had gone by with the last shreds of autumn, and December was passing, when the scouts began to return.\n",
      "The sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir, were the last to return; they had made a great journey, passing down the Silverlode into a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak to any save to Elrond.\n",
      "'Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Elrond summoned the hobbits to him.\n",
      "He looked gravely at Frodo.\n",
      "Do you still hold to your word, Frodo, that you will be the Ring-bearer?'\n",
      "'I do,' said Frodo.\n",
      "`Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel,' said Elrond.\n",
      "With you and your faithful servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, and maybe the end of his labours.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "`I ask leave once again to be your companion, Frodo.'\n",
      "`I would have begged you to come,' said Frodo, 'only I thought you were going to Minas Tirith with Boromir.'\n",
      "'There remain two more to be found,' said Elrond.\n",
      "We want to go with Frodo.'\n",
      "`That is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies ahead,' said Elrond.\n",
      "`Neither does Frodo,' said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin.\n",
      "I think, Elrond, that in this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdom.\n",
      "`You speak gravely,' said Elrond, `but I am in doubt.\n",
      "`Then, Master Elrond, you will have to lock me in prison, or send me home tied in a sack,' said Pippin.\n",
      "You shall go,' said Elrond, and he sighed.\n",
      "Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond.\n",
      "Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo.\n",
      "In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.\n",
      "or scraps of his verses, or would take notes of Frodo's adventures.\n",
      "On the morning of the last day Frodo was alone with Bilbo, and the old hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box.\n",
      "Frodo accepted it gratefully.\n",
      "`I should look – well, I don't think I should look right in it,' said Frodo.\n",
      "`Very well, I will take it,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Bilbo put it on him, and fastened Sting upon the glittering belt; and then Frodo put over the top his old weather-stained breeches, tunic, and jacket.\n",
      "'I cannot thank you as I should, Bilbo, for this, and for all our past kindnesses,' said Frodo.\n",
      "They were to start at dusk, for Elrond counselled them to journey under cover of night as often as they could, until they were far from Rivendell.\n",
      "Slow should you be to wind that horn again, Boromir, said Elrond.\n",
      "The younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow; but Frodo took only Sting; and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden.\n",
      "Gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring, the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely Mountain.\n",
      "All were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes, and they had jackets and cloaks lined with fur.\n",
      "Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they were only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house.\n",
      "Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside Frodo.\n",
      "Aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees; only Elrond knew fully what this hour meant to him.\n",
      "Sam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his mind all the things that he had stowed in it, wondering if he had forgotten anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the little box of salt that he always carried and refilled when he could; a good supply of pipe-weed (but not near enough, I'll warrant); flint and tinder; woollen hose: linen; various small belongings of his master's that Frodo had forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were called for.\n",
      "     At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called the Company to him.\n",
      "'Maybe,' said Elrond, `but let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has not seen the nightfall.'\n",
      "`Or break it,' said Elrond.\n",
      "'I don't suppose you will be able to keep a diary, Frodo my lad, but I shall expect a full account when you get back.\n",
      "Many others of Elrond's household stood in the shadows and watched them go, bidding them farewell with soft voices.\n",
      "Away in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company was taking.\n",
      "Gandalf stood at Frodo's side and looked out under his hand.\n",
      "`Dangerous or not, a real sunrise is mighty welcome,' said Frodo, throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face.\n",
      "'No,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "There are many maps in Elrond's house, but I suppose you never thought to look at them?'\n",
      "Frodo has a better head for that sort of thing.'\n",
      "`It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "`May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf l' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'To the end of the journey – in the end,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "`Well, you can go on looking forward,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Too warm, I shouldn't wonder,' muttered Sam to Frodo.\n",
      "It looked to Frodo like the remains of an ancient road, that had once been broad and well planned, from Hollin to the mountain-pass.\n",
      "Frodo looked up at the sky.\n",
      "he whispered to Gandalf, who was just ahead.\n",
      "Gandalf snuffed the air and looked back.\n",
      "Frodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn were continuing some debate that had begun long before.\n",
      "'I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well, Gandalf,' answered Aragorn.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'We must decide before we go further,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "     In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras.\n",
      "Frodo watched them, wondering which way the debate would go.\n",
      "When they returned to the Company Gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face the weather and the high pass.\n",
      "He could not guess what was the other dark and secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill Aragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been abandoned.\n",
      "`From signs that we have seen lately,' said Gandalf, 'I fear that the Redhorn Gate may be watched; and also I have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind.\n",
      "'Very well,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo felt a soft touch on his face.\n",
      "But before long the snow was falling fast, filling all the air, and swirling into Frodo's eyes.\n",
      "The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen.\n",
      "Gandalf halted.\n",
      "'His arm has grown long,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo's feet felt like lead.\n",
      "`It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack; said Gandalf.\n",
      "He was leaning on Merry and Frodo, and he was shivering.\n",
      "`Either stop where we are, or go back,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream.\n",
      "_Snowstorms on January the twelfth: there was no need to come back to report that!_\n",
      "     _But I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo_, Frodo answered with an effort, when he felt himself shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness.\n",
      "`This will be the death of the halflings, Gandalf,' said Boromir.\n",
      "`Give them this,' said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a leathern flask.\n",
      "Elrond gave it to me at our parting.\n",
      "As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a new strength of heart, and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs.\n",
      "'The choice seems near now between fire and death, Gandalf.\n",
      "'You may make a fire, if you can,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "At last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand.\n",
      "'I have written _Gandalf is here_ in signs that all can read from Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.'\n",
      "Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire; but for a long time he could see no sign of their slackening.\n",
      "`If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a path for you,' said Legolas.\n",
      "`If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun to save us,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "With that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the snow.\n",
      "he said to Gandalf.\n",
      "Behind in the narrow but now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli perched among the baggage.\n",
      "Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo.\n",
      "They passed through the lane; but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snow.\n",
      "Frodo's legs ached.\n",
      "'That cannot be helped now,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of Rivendell.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "'We still have our journey and our errand before us,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo looked troubled.\n",
      "`You are right, Frodo,' said Gandalf: `to go back is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come.\n",
      "'Then we must go on, if there is a way,' said Frodo with a sigh.\n",
      "`There is a way that we may attempt,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "`You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to the stronghold of Sauron,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "'I will tread the path with you, Gandalf! '\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "It is not of the Ring, nor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf.\n",
      "Sam looked at Frodo.\n",
      "At last Frodo spoke.\n",
      "`I do not wish to go,' he said; `but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "`There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,' answered Gandalf grimly.\n",
      "`I wish I had taken Elrond's advice,' muttered Pippin to Sam.\n",
      "Whatever may be in store for old Gandalf, I'll wager it isn't a wolf's belly.'\n",
      "Gandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft.\n",
      "`Gandalf is here.\n",
      "Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting packs had fled.\n",
      "Suddenly Frodo started from sleep.\n",
      "cried Gandalf to the hobbits.\n",
      "In the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey shapes spring over the ring of stones.\n",
      "In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill.\n",
      "`It is as I feared,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "`We must reach the doors before sunset,' said Gandalf, 'or I fear we shall not reach them at all.\n",
      "`I do not know which to hope,' said Boromir grimly: `that Gandalf will find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for ever.\n",
      "But either Gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in recent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it, only a few miles southwards from their start.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly up them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo.\n",
      "No sign of gate or entrance, not a fissure or crack could Frodo see in the frowning stone.\n",
      "`There are the Walls of Moria,' said Gandalf, pointing across the water.\n",
      "`But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "`I am sorry,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was making for; and then he had still to find the doors.\n",
      "Frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean water on his feet.\n",
      "Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as quickly as they could.\n",
      "two tall trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'I have heard both,' said Gandalf; 'and I will not give judgement now.\n",
      "'But you can't leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place, Mr. Gandalf! '\n",
      "'He'd follow Mr. Frodo into a dragon's den, if I led him,' protested Sam.\n",
      "'It will be short of murder, I hope,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Make your ways to places where you can find grass, and so come in time to Elrond's house, or wherever you wish to go.\n",
      "When this was done they turned to watch Gandalf.\n",
      "'But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,' said Gandalf, coming suddenly to life and turning round.\n",
      "\n",
      "     At the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of interlacing letters in an Elvish character.\n",
      "`And the Star of the House of Fëanor,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "asked Frodo, who was trying to decipher the inscription on the arch.\n",
      "`The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the Elder Days,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'these doors are probably governed by words.\n",
      "'But do not _you_ know the word, Gandalf? '\n",
      "The others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf well, remained silent and unmoved.\n",
      "`Knock on the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Again Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "'Why doesn't Gandalf do something quick? '\n",
      "Gandalf took no notice of them.\n",
      "`I was wrong after all,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli too.\n",
      "Frodo felt something seize him by the ankle, and he fell with a cry.\n",
      "Sam leaped after him, and then hearing Frodo's cry he ran back again, weeping and cursing.\n",
      "Its fingered end had hold of Frodo's foot and was dragging him into the water.\n",
      "The arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out for help.\n",
      "shouted Gandalf leaping back.\n",
      "Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff-wall and the doors.\n",
      "Gandalf turned and paused.\n",
      "Sam, clinging to Frodo's arm, collapsed on a step in the black darkness.\n",
      "I had to choose, Mr. Frodo.\n",
      "They heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors.\n",
      "`I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot first touched the water,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'I do not know,' answered Gandalf, 'but the arms were all guided by one purpose.\n",
      "He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it was that dwelt in the lake, it had seized on Frodo first among all the Company.\n",
      "'I will,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli shall walk with me.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "After they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "'I cannot say,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf walked in front as before.\n",
      "Behind the dwarf walked Frodo, and he had drawn the short sword, Sting.\n",
      "Behind Frodo went Sam, and after him Legolas, and the young hobbits, and Boromir.\n",
      "In the pale ray of the wizard's staff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and tunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on either side.\n",
      "Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage.\n",
      "Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word.\n",
      "To Gandalf the far-off memories of a journey long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal.\n",
      "There was a pause longer than usual, and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together; the others were crowded behind, waiting anxiously.\n",
      "Frodo's spirits had risen for a while after his escape, and after food and a draught of the cordial; but now a deep uneasiness, growing to dread, crept over him again.\n",
      "One sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf.\n",
      "Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard, something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet.\n",
      "They had been going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came to his first serious check.\n",
      "said Gandalf, standing uncertainly under the arch.\n",
      "cried Gandalf as Merry and Pippin pushed forward, glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the open passage.\n",
      "cried Gandalf.\n",
      "`Yes,' said Gandalf, 'and I do not like it.\n",
      "He wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep.\n",
      "Actually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent.\n",
      "It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep.\n",
      "As the road climbed upwards` Frodo's spirits rose a little; but he still felt oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard, away behind the Company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet, a following footstep that was not an echo.\n",
      "Gandalf seemed pleased.\n",
      "`That is all that I shall venture on for the present,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'For _mithril_,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "'Yes,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the rings of his mail-shirt.\n",
      "Frodo was on guard.\n",
      "Frodo sat up.\n",
      "said Gandalf: `For morning it is again at last.\n",
      "After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once.\n",
      "'Maybe,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "`It looks like a tomb,' muttered Frodo, and bent forwards with a curious sense of foreboding, to look more closely at it.\n",
      "Gandalf came quickly to his side.\n",
      "Frodo thought of Bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf, and of Balin's visit to the Shire long ago.\n",
      "Gandalf lifted it carefully, but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the slab.\n",
      "Frodo and Gimli standing at his side could see, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that they were written by many different hands, in runes, both of Moria and of Dale, and here and there in Elvish script.\n",
      "At last Gandalf looked up.\n",
      "`Well, I can read no more for a long way,' said Gandalf, 'except the word _gold_, and _Durin's Axe_ and something _helm_.\n",
      "Suddenly, and to his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in his heart.\n",
      "There was a bellow, and the foot jerked back, nearly wrenching Sting from Frodo's arm.\n",
      "You have a good blade, Frodo son of Drogo! '\n",
      "cried Gandalf.\n",
      "Diving under Aragorn's blow with the speed of a striking snake he charged into the Company and thrust with his spear straight at Frodo.\n",
      "The blow caught him on the right side, and Frodo was hurled against the wall and pinned.\n",
      "shouted Gandalf.\n",
      "     Aragorn picked up Frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the stair, pushing Merry and Pippin in front of him.\n",
      "'I am all right,' gasped Frodo.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf fiercely.\n",
      "Frodo breathed heavily and leaned against Sam, who put his arms about him.\n",
      "Frodo thought he could hear the voice of Gandalf above, muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo.\n",
      "Gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company.\n",
      "Gandalf took no turns, right or left, for the passage seemed to be going in the direction that he desired.\n",
      "Gandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind man.\n",
      "At the bottom of the seventh flight Gandalf halted.\n",
      "'I do not know,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "And now what about you, Frodo?\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "'Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad to say,' said Frodo; `though I feel as if I had been caught between a hammer and an anvil.'\n",
      "'You take after Bilbo,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said.\n",
      "`_Ghâsh!_' muttered Gandalf.\n",
      "When they came to the arch Gandalf went through, signing to them to wait.\n",
      "'If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we should have been trapped here,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "An arrow whistled over Frodo's head.\n",
      "called Gandalf.\n",
      "Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm.\n",
      "At the brink Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind.\n",
      "One struck Frodo and sprang back.\n",
      "Another pierced Gandalf's hat and stuck there like a black feather.\n",
      "Frodo looked behind.\n",
      "'A Balrog,' muttered Gandalf.\n",
      "`Farewell, Gandalf! '\n",
      "'Come with me, Frodo! '\n",
      "Frodo followed slowly, drawn by the still blue water in spite of hurt and weariness; Sam came up behind.\n",
      "For I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose, and first I hope to come to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the Great River-out yonder.'\n",
      "For some time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with the others; but Aragorn was leading them at a great pace, and after a while they lagged behind.\n",
      "Frodo felt every step more painful and he gasped for breath.\n",
      "'I am sorry, Frodo! '\n",
      "While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and fir-wood, and drew water, Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo! '\n",
      "'I am all right,' said Frodo, reluctant to have his garments touched.\n",
      "Gently he stripped off Frodo's old jacket and worn tunic, and gave a gasp of wonder.\n",
      "Is this the coat that Gandalf spoke of?\n",
      "There was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo's right side and breast.\n",
      "Frodo's left side also was scored and bruised where he had been hurled against the wall.\n",
      "Soon Frodo felt the pain leave him, and his breath grew easy: though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days.\n",
      "Sam and Frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair pace, and with only one brief halt Aragorn led the Company on for nearly three more hours.\n",
      "Gimli and Frodo were at the rear, walking softly and not speaking, listening for any sound upon the road behind.\n",
      "Frodo did not answer.\n",
      "answered Frodo.\n",
      "For a moment Frodo stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet.\n",
      "Almost Frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing, mingled with the sound of the water.\n",
      "     As he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some on one side, some on another, and some set about the bole of the tree, so that the ladder passed through them.\n",
      "Haldir led Frodo before them, and the Lord welcomed him in his own tongue.\n",
      "`Sit now beside my chair, Frodo of the Shire! '\n",
      "Elrond is far away, and darkness gathers between us, and all this year the shadows have grown longer.'\n",
      "`Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company, but he did not pass the borders of this land.\n",
      "`Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow.\n",
      "`Yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'Gandalf was our guide, and he led us through Moria; and when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.'\n",
      "And if it were possible, one would say that at the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net of Moria.'\n",
      "`Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.\n",
      "'Your quest is known to us,' said Galadriel, looking at Frodo.\n",
      "Yet not in vain will it prove, maybe, that you came to this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed.\n",
      "And if my designs had not gone amiss, it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey, and then mayhap things would have gone otherwise.\n",
      "And as for Frodo, he would not speak, though Boromir pressed him with questions.\n",
      "`Yes,' said Frodo; `but whatever came into my mind then I will keep there.'\n",
      "Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds.\n",
      "It was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words.\n",
      "One evening Frodo and Sam were walking together in the cool twilight.\n",
      "On Frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen: he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave Lothlórien.\n",
      "'You can see and feel it everywhere,' said Frodo.\n",
      "No fireworks like poor Gandalf used to show.\n",
      "I'd dearly love to see some Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo! '\n",
      "'I wouldn't,' said Frodo.\n",
      "And I don't miss Gandalf's fireworks, but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.'\n",
      "It's when we leave this land that we shall miss Gandalf worse, I'm thinking.'\n",
      "'I am afraid that's only too true, Sam,' said Frodo.\n",
      "asked Frodo, filled with awe.\n",
      "Frodo did not answer.\n",
      "`And I'd not mind a glimpse of what's going on at home,' he said in an aside to Frodo.\n",
      "But before Sam could make up his mind what it was that he saw, the light faded; and now he thought he saw Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff.\n",
      "'Elrond knew what he was about when he wanted to send Mr. Merry back.'\n",
      "`No, I'll go home by the long road with Mr. Frodo, or not at all,' he said.\n",
      "`Do you now wish to look, Frodo? '\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "Yet I think, Frodo, that you have courage and wisdom enough for the venture, or I would not have brought you here.\n",
      "`I will look,' said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water.\n",
      "Suddenly Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf.\n",
      "Doubt came into Frodo's mind: was this a vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it Saruman?\n",
      "Then there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become involved.\n",
      "It vanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away.\n",
      "But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness.\n",
      "So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze.\n",
      "Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was one.\n",
      "The vision faded, and Frodo found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basin.\n",
      "I say to you, Frodo, that even as I speak to you, I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind, or all of his mind that concerns the Elves.\n",
      "Frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed to him that he understood.\n",
      "`Yes,' she said, divining his thought, `it is not permitted to speak of it, and Elrond could not do so.\n",
      "Frodo bent his head.\n",
      "'You are wise and fearless and fair, Lady Galadriel,' said Frodo.\n",
      "She stood before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond enduring, terrible and worshipful.\n",
      "`I would ask one thing before we go,' said Frodo, `a thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell.\n",
      "Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each possessor?\n",
      "'Beyond Lothlórien I do not know what Gandalf intended to do.\n",
      "They would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into the shadow of Mordor; but Frodo spoke no word, and Aragorn was still divided in his mind.\n",
      "His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor.\n",
      "But in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him; and he knew that he could not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in the end to go with Boromir.\n",
      "And yet what help could he or any of the Company give to Frodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness?\n",
      "`I shall go to Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for it is my duty,' said Boromir; and after that he was silent for a while, sitting with his eyes fixed on Frodo, as if he was trying to read the Halfling's thoughts.\n",
      "Frodo caught something new and strange in Boromir's glance, and he looked hard at him.\n",
      "He had said something like this at the Council, but then he had accepted the correction of Elrond.\n",
      "Frodo looked at Aragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign that he had heeded Boromir's words.\n",
      "Frodo greeted him with delight.\n",
      "The Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in one boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in another; and in the third were Legolas and Gimli, who had now become fast friends.\n",
      "'I am out of my reckoning,' he said to Frodo.\n",
      "Even as he spoke Frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone.\n",
      "One smote Frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward with a cry, letting go his paddle: but the arrow fell back.\n",
      "said Sam to Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo looked up at the Elf standing tall above him, as he gazed into the night, seeking a mark to shoot at.\n",
      "Frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutching at his heart; there was a deadly cold, like the memory of an old wound, in his shoulder.\n",
      "Frodo looked up.\n",
      "'It was not a Balrog,' said Frodo, still shivering with the chill that had come upon him.\n",
      "asked Boromir eagerly, leaning from his boat, as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of Frodo's face.\n",
      "`I think – No, I will not say,' answered Frodo.\n",
      "You'll remember, Mr. Frodo, the Moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that tree: a week from the full, I reckon.\n",
      "`And perhaps that was the way of it,' said Frodo.\n",
      "`But the wearing is slow in Lórien,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Boromir held out long against this choice; but when it became plain that Frodo would follow Aragorn, wherever he went, he gave in.\n",
      "It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb the steep bank and vanish into the mists; but his fears proved groundless.\n",
      "Frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching: like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed.\n",
      "As Frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to meet him.\n",
      "Awe and fear fell upon Frodo, and he cowered down, shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as the boat drew near.\n",
      "Frodo crouching over his knees heard Sam in front muttering and groaning: `What a place!\n",
      "Frodo turned and saw Strider, and yet not Strider; for the weatherworn Ranger was no longer there.\n",
      "Then the light of his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: `Would that Gandalf were here!\n",
      "It bent somewhat towards the west so that at first all was dark ahead; but soon Frodo saw a tall gap of light before him, ever growing.\n",
      "In the small hours he got up and came to Frodo, whose turn it was to watch.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo then drew the elf-blade from its sheath.\n",
      "Frodo looked out eastward and gazed at the tall island.\n",
      "'Well, Frodo,' said Aragorn at last.\n",
      "I am not Gandalf, and though I have tried to bear his part, I do not know what design or hope he had for this hour, if indeed he had any.\n",
      "Frodo did not answer at once.\n",
      "`Very well, Frodo son of Drogo,' he said.\n",
      "Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed.\n",
      ",\n",
      "     Presently Frodo got up and walked away; and Sam saw that while the others restrained themselves and did not stare at him, the eyes of Boromir followed Frodo intently, until he passed out of sight in the trees at the foot of Amon Hen.\n",
      "Wandering aimlessly at first in the wood, Frodo found that his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill.\n",
      "Frodo halted and looked out over the River, far below him, to Tol Brandir and the birds wheeling in the great gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle.\n",
      "All that had happened since Bilbo left the Shire was passing through his mind, and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of Gandalf's words.\n",
      "`I was afraid for you, Frodo,' he said, coming forward.\n",
      "`You are kind,' answered Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo shivered.\n",
      "'I think I know already what counsel you would give, Boromir,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'No hope while the Ring lasts,' said Frodo.\n",
      "And I have seen it only for an instant in the House of Elrond.\n",
      "Frodo looked up.\n",
      "answered Frodo.\n",
      "'Gandalf, Elrond – all these folk have taught you to say so.\n",
      "Boromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly: Almost he seemed to have forgotten Frodo, while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the mustering of men; and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious victories to be; and he cast down Mordor, and became himself a mighty king, benevolent and wise.\n",
      "he said, turning now suddenly to Frodo again.\n",
      "'No, I am afraid,' said Frodo.\n",
      "`You misunderstand me,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Come with me, Frodo,' he said.\n",
      "He laid his hand on the hobbit's shoulder in friendly fashion; but Frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement.\n",
      "cried Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo did not answer, but moved away till the great flat stone stood between them.\n",
      "For I am too strong for you, halfling,' he cried; and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped at Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them.\n",
      "Frodo, Frodo! '\n",
      "Frodo did not even hear his cries.\n",
      "Frodo, neither the Voice nor the Eye: free to choose, and with one remaining instant in which to do so.\n",
      "Frodo rose to his feet.\n",
      "But always their thoughts and words strayed back to Frodo and the Ring.\n",
      "What would Frodo choose to do?\n",
      "`We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but the Lord Denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even Elrond said was beyond his power: either to keep the Burden secret.\n",
      "Which way would any of us choose in Frodo's place?\n",
      "Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.'\n",
      "Why cannot we decide, and so help Frodo?\n",
      "Yet I have come so far, and I say this: now we have reached the last choice, it is clear to me that I cannot leave Frodo.\n",
      "'We can't leave Frodo!\n",
      "It would be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor.\n",
      "But Mr. Frodo, he knows he's got to find the Cracks of Doom, if he can.\n",
      "`Well, I wish Frodo would \"screw himself up\" and come back.\n",
      "`Have you seen Frodo? '\n",
      "Why should Mr. Frodo put the thing on?\n",
      "`How long is it since you saw Frodo last, Boromir? '\n",
      "Merry and Pippin had followed, and were already disappearing westward into the trees by the shore, shouting: _Frodo!\n",
      "Frodo!_ in their clear, high hobbit-voices.\n",
      "Go after those two young hobbits, and guard them at the least, even if you cannot find Frodo.\n",
      "'Frodo ran to the hill-top.\n",
      "'I tried to take the Ring from Frodo ' he said.\n",
      "Was Frodo there?'\n",
      "Vain was Gandalf's trust in me.\n",
      "Where is Frodo?'\n",
      "I sent him to follow Merry and Pippin; but I did not ask him if Frodo or Sam were with him: not until it was too late.\n",
      "It is as Gandalf feared: by some means the traitor Saruman has had news of our journey.\n",
      "It is likely too that he knows of Gandalf's fall.\n",
      "It will be hard news for Frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in Rivendell.\n",
      "Elrond was against their coming.'\n",
      "'But Gandalf was not,' said Legolas.\n",
      "'But Gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost ' answered Gimli.\n",
      "'The counsel of Gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for himself or for others,' said Aragorn.\n",
      "Elrond says that the two are akin, the last strongholds of the mighty woods of the Elder Days, in which the Firstborn roamed while Men still slept.\n",
      "     Pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that he could hear his own small voice echoing in black tunnels, calling _Frodo, Frodo!_ But instead of Frodo hundreds of hideous orc-faces grinned at him out of the shadows, hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side.\n",
      "'I wish Gandalf had never persuaded Elrond to let us come,' he thought.\n",
      "He wished now that he had learned more in Rivendell, and looked more at maps and things; but in those days the plans for the journey seemed to be in more competent hands, and he had never reckoned with being cut off from Gandalf, or from Strider, and even from Frodo.\n",
      "All that he could remember about Rohan was that Gandalf's horse, Shadowfax, had come from that land.\n",
      "'No, I did not find them,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'that was Gwaihir the Windlord, who rescued me from Orthanc.\n",
      "'Then you know about Frodo!'\n",
      "said Gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face.\n",
      "For a long while Gandalf said nothing, and he asked no questions.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf, and paused for a while in thought.\n",
      "'Indeed yes,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'The victor would emerge stronger than either, and free from doubt,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'One that you cannot slay with arrows,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Was it you, Gandalf, or Saruman that we saw last night?'\n",
      "'You certainly did not see me,' answered Gandalf, 'therefore I must guess that you saw Saruman.\n",
      "Gandalf laughed again.\n",
      "'With Treebeard and the Ents,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "now you are asking much,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "cried Gandalf.\n",
      "'I do not know,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Very different from old Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel, perhaps, now that his wickedness has been laid bare, but very few others.'\n",
      "'Gandalf!'\n",
      "Gandalf obviously expected to find Treebeard here; and Treebeard might almost have been loitering about near the gates on purpose to meet him.\n",
      "I can only suppose that he had seen Gandalf or had some news of him, but would not say anything in a hurry.\n",
      "\"Don't be hasty\" is his motto; but nobody, not even Elves, will say much about Gandalf's movements when he is not there.\n",
      "Gandalf!\"\n",
      "'\"Treebeard,\" said Gandalf.\n",
      "It must have seemed very hasty to Treebeard, for Gandalf was in a tremendous hurry, and was already talking at a great pace, before they passed out of hearing.\n",
      "Then Gandalf came back to us, and he seemed relieved, almost merry.\n",
      "'\"But Gandalf,\" I cried, \"where have you been?\n",
      "'\"Wherever I have been, I am back,\" he answered in the genuine Gandalf manner.\n",
      "'Treebeard was very thoughtful after Gandalf had gone.\n",
      "But for the moment we thought more about you three than about Frodo and Sam, or about poor Boromir.\n",
      "To all appearances Gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help Frodo.\n",
      "Sam's guess was that the Sméagol and Gollum halves (or what in his own mind he called Slinker and Stinker) had made a truce and a temporary alliance: neither wanted the Enemy to get the Ring; both wished to keep Frodo from capture, and under their eye, as long as possible – at any rate as long as Stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his 'Precious'.\n",
      "`If he knew that Mr. Frodo is trying to put an end to his Precious for good and all, there'd be trouble pretty quick, I bet.\n",
      "Frodo did not answer Gollum at once.\n",
      "As he gazed Frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement on the plain.\n",
      "As if suddenly made fully aware of the peril of their position, alone, in the growing light of day, so near to this vast menace, Frodo quickly drew his frail grey hood close upon his head, and stepped down into the dell.\n",
      "'I did not mean the danger that we all share,' said Frodo.\n",
      "It had always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear Mr. Frodo was of such a high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness.\n",
      "Of course, he also firmly held the incompatible belief that Mr. Frodo was the wisest person in the world (with the possible exception of Old Mr. Bilbo and of Gandalf).\n",
      "Frodo waited patiently for a while, then he spoke again less sternly.\n",
      "But Gollum was in a pitiable state, and Frodo's threat had quite unnerved him.\n",
      "After a while he grew a little calmer, and Frodo gathered bit by bit that, if a traveller followed the road that turned west of Ephel Dúath, he would come in time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "`That would be Minas Ithil that Isildur the son of Elendil built ' said Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "'Not nice hobbit, not sensible,' said Gollum, giving Sam an angry glance and turning to Frodo.\n",
      "asked Frodo.\n",
      "asked Frodo sternly.\n",
      "Frodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter Gollum was for once not so far from the truth as might be suspected; that he had somehow found a way out of Mordor, and at least believed that it was by his own cunning.\n",
      "But even if Gollum could be trusted on this point, Frodo did not forget the wiles of the Enemy.\n",
      "Frodo repeated.\n",
      "Aragorn could perhaps have told them that name and its significance: Gandalf would have warned them.\n",
      "But they were alone, and Aragorn was far away, and Gandalf stood amid the ruin of Isengard and strove with Saruman, delayed by treason.\n",
      "his thought was ever upon Frodo and Samwise, over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity.\n",
      "Maybe Frodo felt it, not knowing it, as he had upon Amon Hen, even though he believed that Gandalf was gone, gone for ever into the shadow in Moria far away.\n",
      "He sat upon the ground for a long while, silent, his head bowed, striving to recall all that Gandalf had said to him.\n",
      "Indeed Gandalf's guidance had been taken from them too soon, too soon, while the Dark Land was still very far away.\n",
      "How they should enter it at the last Gandalf had not said.\n",
      "Frodo did not think so.\n",
      "Frodo stood up.\n",
      "`I wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with Gandalf on a white one at their head,' he said.\n",
      "cried Gollum in delight, patting Frodo's knees.\n",
      "     There was nothing for Frodo to do but to fall in with this request, or order.\n",
      "They set out at once: Mablung and Damrod a little ahead, and Faramir with Frodo and Sam behind.\n",
      "You were not wholly frank with me, Frodo.'\n",
      "`I told no lies, and of the truth all I could,' said Frodo.\n",
      "`Near,' said Frodo, 'but not in the gold.\n",
      "`But, Frodo, I pressed you hard at first about _Isildur's Bane_.\n",
      "'It does,' said Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "_Mithrandir among the Elves, Tharkûn to the Dwarves; Olórin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Incánus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not._'\n",
      "     'Gandalf!'\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "Gandalf the Grey dearest of counsellors.\n",
      "yes,' said Frodo.\n",
      "I do not wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.'\n",
      "'Neither did the Council,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo made no answer.\n",
      "Neither Frodo nor Sam refused anything that was offered, nor a second, nor indeed a third helping.\n",
      "Frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk.\n",
      "Sam was beaming and humming to himself, but when Frodo spoke he was at first content to listen, only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of agreement.\n",
      "Frodo told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from the quest of the Company and from the Ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part Boromir had played in all their adventures.\n",
      "with the wolves of the wild, in the snows under Caradhras, and in the mines of Moria where Gandalf fell.\n",
      "`He was the last,' said Frodo, 'but Aragorn was forced to lead us.\n",
      "He alone knew the way after Gandalf's fall.\n",
      "But tell me now of your own fortunes,' said Frodo, turning the matter aside once again.\n",
      "'Well, Frodo, now at last we understand one another,' said Faramir.\n",
      "`Not all is well there,' said Frodo, `but certainly gardeners are honoured.'\n",
      "I do not wish to see it, or touch it, or know more of it than I know (which is enough), lest peril perchance waylay me and I fall lower in the test than Frodo son of Drogo.\n",
      "Frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed.\n",
      "Gandalf said so.\n",
      "But I can say this: you have an air too, sir, that reminds me of, of – well, Gandalf, of wizards.\n",
      "What have you to say now, Frodo?\n",
      "`The creature is wretched and hungry,' said Frodo, `and unaware of his danger.\n",
      "And Gandalf, your Mithrandir, he would have bidden you not to slay him for that reason, and for others.\n",
      "I would do much for you, Frodo, but this I cannot grant: to let this sly wanderer go free at his own will from here, to join you later if it please him, or to be caught by Orcs and tell all he knows under threat of pain.\n",
      "`Let me go down quietly to him,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Lead Frodo down to the bank, Anborn, and go softly.\n",
      "Passing silently through, Frodo found himself on the top of the southern bank above the pool.\n",
      "he breathed in Frodo's ear.\n",
      "Frodo crept forward, using his hands Gollum-like to feel his way and to steady himself.\n",
      "Frodo shivered, listening with pity and disgust.\n",
      "Only one true shot, and Frodo would be rid of the miserable voice for ever.\n",
      "Frodo knew, too, somehow, quite clearly that Gandalf would not have wished it.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "`There's no time,' said Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo desperately.\n",
      "He came close to Frodo, almost nose to nose, and sniffed at him.\n",
      "`Yes, we'll go soon,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'Away up there,' said Frodo, pointing to the waterfall.\n",
      "He did not really fear that Faramir would allow Gollum to be killed, but he would probably make him prisoner and bind him; and certainly what Frodo did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature.\n",
      "It would probably be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that Frodo had saved his life in the only way he could.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo followed them, feeling very wretched.\n",
      "he said to Frodo.\n",
      "I have spared you so far at the prayer of Frodo here, who says that of him at least you have deserved some thanks.\n",
      "Unloose him Frodo! '\n",
      "Faramir took a small nail-knife from his belt and handed it to Frodo.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "`Master knows,' said Gollum with a sidelong glance at Frodo.\n",
      "He crawled to Frodo's feet.\n",
      "`Yes,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo slept unquietly, turning and tossing, and sometimes murmuring.\n",
      "Twice Sam thought he heard him speaking Gandalf's name.\n",
      "Master, wake u He clawed at Frodo; and Frodo, startled out of sleep, sat up suddenly and seized him by the arm.\n",
      "Sam was filled with deep suspicion, and showed it; but Frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind.\n",
      "     Frodo stirred.\n",
      "`Wake up, Mr. Frodo!\n",
      "`Wake up, Mr. Frodo!\n",
      "'Wake up, Mr. Frodo!\n",
      "Come on, Mr. Frodo! '\n",
      "Frodo raised his head, and then stood up.\n",
      "He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel or Gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose.\n",
      "Frodo and Sam at first felt easier, having now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder, and as they climbed up and up, they became more and more aware of the long black fall behind them.\n",
      "He knelt and held Frodo's hand and could not release it.\n",
      "`I wish old Gandalf was hare or somebody.\n",
      "And as for not being the right and proper person, why, Mr. Frodo wasn't as you might say, nor Mr. Bilbo.\n",
      "'Let me see now: if we're found here, or Mr. Frodo's found, and that Thing's on him, well, the Enemy will get it.\n",
      "Very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped his hand inside Frodo's tunic; then with his other hand raising the head, he kissed the cold forehead, and softly drew the chain over it.\n",
      "No change came over the still face, and by that more than by all other tokens Sam was convinced at last that Frodo had died and laid aside the Quest.\n",
      "And for a moment he lifted up the Phial and looked down at his master, and the light burned gently now with the soft radiance of the evening-star in summer, and in that light Frodo's face was fair of hue again, pale but beautiful with an elvish beauty, as of one who has long passed the shadows.\n",
      "     Pippin looked out from the shelter of Gandalf's cloak.\n",
      "But Gandalf had spoken soft words to him, and he had slept in a corner, tired but uneasy, dimly aware of comings and goings and of men talking and Gandalf giving orders.\n",
      "A light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers Pippin cowered back, afraid for a moment, wondering into what dreadful country Gandalf was bearing him.\n",
      "'Where are we, Gandalf?'\n",
      "cried Pippin suddenly, clutching at Gandalf's cloak.\n",
      "For answer Gandalf cried aloud to his horse.\n",
      "Pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling him of the customs of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City had beacons built on the tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range, and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his errand-riders to Rohan in the North, or to Belfalas in the South.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'For you are not going like Frodo to Mordor, but to Minas Tirith, and there you will be as safe as you can be anywhere in these days.\n",
      "He wondered where Frodo was, and if he was already in Mordor, or if he was dead; and he did not know that Frodo from far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond Gondor ere the coming of the day.\n",
      "Quickly Gandalf strode across the white-paved court.\n",
      "Pippin glanced at it as he hurried after Gandalf.\n",
      "_Seven stars and seven stones and one white tree._\n",
      "     The words that Gandalf had murmured came back into his mind.\n",
      "They walked down a paved passage, long and empty, and as they went Gandalf spoke softly to Pippin.\n",
      "Do not tell him more than you need, and leave quiet the matter of Frodo's errand.\n",
      "'Maybe, maybe,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal.\n",
      "'Yes,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of Frodo and Sam.\n",
      "There he found the remaining strength of his people already assembled; for as soon as his coming was known captains rode to meet him at the ford, bearing messages from Gandalf.\n",
      "'Shadowfax came like a wind out of the West to Edoras, and Gandalf brought tidings of your victory to gladden our hearts.\n",
      "'We saw it also, but that was in the dead of night before Gandalf left us.'\n",
      "Then it was that Gandalf counselled us not to assemble in the fields, but to meet you here in the valley under the mountains.\n",
      "Gandalf spoke with great authority.\n",
      "They have all gone to some doom: Gandalf and Pippin to war in the East; and Sam and Frodo to Mordor; and Strider and Legolas and Gimli to the Paths of the Dead.\n",
      "     Pippin was roused by Gandalf.\n",
      "'Past the second hour,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'You know quite well,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Before long he was walking with Gandalf once more down the cold corridor to the door of the Tower Hall.\n",
      "He beckoned Gandalf to a seat, but Pippin was left for a while standing unheeded.\n",
      "Denethor turned to Gandalf, asking questions about the Rohirrim and their policies, and the position of Éomer, the king's nephew.\n",
      "It was the sunset-hour, but the great pall had now stretched far into the West, and only as it sank at last into the Sea did the Sun escape to send out a brief farewell gleam before the night, even as Frodo saw it at the Cross-roads touching the head of the fallen king.\n",
      "I have kicked my heels at the door of my master's chamber for many slow hours, while he has debated with Gandalf and the Prince and other great persons.\n",
      "'Yes,' said Pippin, 'Gandalf, too, is anxious.\n",
      "Gandalf!\n",
      "Gandalf save us!'\n",
      "'Gandalf!'\n",
      "'Gandalf!\n",
      "Gandalf, Gandalf!'\n",
      "They dismounted, and as grooms took Shadowfax and the other horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate: Gandalf steadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still smouldering in his eyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man.\n",
      "But with that Gandalf stepped to his side and spoke.\n",
      "Removed a little upon the other side sat Gandalf in a chair of carven wood; and he seemed at first to be asleep.\n",
      "At that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin's lips.\n",
      "Slowly, while the others sat silent and still, Faramir told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen.\n",
      "As his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and of the events at Henneth Annûn, Pippin became aware that Gandalf's hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood.\n",
      "White they seemed now and very old, and as he looked at them, suddenly with a thrill of fear Pippin knew that Gandalf, Gandalf himself, was troubled, even afraid.\n",
      "Then Gandalf sprang up.\n",
      "Gandalf paced the floor.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'You think, as is your wont, my lord, of Gondor only,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Nonetheless I do not trust you,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "For a moment the eyes of Denethor glowed again as he faced Gandalf, and Pippin felt once more the strain between their wills; but now almost it seemed as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye, flickering as they fenced.\n",
      "Outside there was a starless blackness as Gandalf with Pippin beside him bearing a small torch, made his way to their lodging.\n",
      "Then at last Pippin took Gandalf's hand.\n",
      "For Frodo, I mean; or at least mostly for Frodo.'\n",
      "Gandalf put his hand on Pippin's head.\n",
      "For it seems clear that our Enemy has opened his war at last and made the first move while Frodo was still free.\n",
      "Gandalf stood for a moment in thought.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'I cannot answer that now,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Yet my heart guessed that Frodo and Gollum would meet before the end.\n",
      "Gandalf it was that last spoke to Faramir ere he rode east.\n",
      "'Yes, he will come,' said Gandalf, 'even if he comes too late.\n",
      "There was Gandalf as chief herald, and Aragorn with the sons of Elrond, and Éomer of Rohan, and Imrahil; and Legolas and Gimli and Peregrin were bidden to go also, so that all the enemies of Mordor should have a witness.\n",
      "'Where such laws hold,' said Gandalf, 'it is also the custom for ambassadors to use less insolence.\n",
      "But this time thou hast stuck out thy nose too far, Master Gandalf; and thou shalt see what comes to him who sets his foolish webs before the feet of Sauron the Great.\n",
      "The Messenger put these aside, and there to the wonder and dismay of all the Captains he held up first the short sword that Sam had carried, and next a grey cloak with an elven-brooch, and last the coat of mithril-mail that Frodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments.\n",
      "said Gandalf sternly, thrusting him back; but the Messenger laughed aloud.\n",
      "'I do not wish to deny them,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Name the terms,' said Gandalf steadily, but those nearby saw the anguish in his face, and now he seemed an old and wizened man, crushed, defeated at last.\n",
      "But Gandalf said: 'This is much to demand for the delivery of one servant: that your Master should receive in exchange what he must else fight many a war to gain!\n",
      "It seemed then to Gandalf, intent, watching him as a man engaged in fencing with a deadly foe, that for the taking of a breath the Messenger was at a loss; yet swiftly he laughed again.\n",
      "said Gandalf suddenly.\n",
      "Before his upraised hand the foul Messenger recoiled, and Gandalf coming seized and took from him the tokens: coat, cloak, and sword.\n",
      "     Pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard Gandalf reject the terms and doom Frodo to the torment of the Tower; but he had mastered himself, and now he stood beside Beregond in the front rank of Gondor with Imrahil's men.\n",
      "Sam took a sip of water, but pressed Frodo to drink, and when his master had recovered a little he gave him a whole wafer of their precious waybread and made him eat it.\n",
      "It looks every step of fifty miles,' he muttered gloomily staring at the threatening mountain, 'and that'll take a week, if it takes a day, with Mr. Frodo as he is.'\n",
      "'So that was the job I felt I had to do when I started,' thought Sam: 'to help Mr. Frodo to the last step and then die with him?\n",
      "I can't think somehow that Gandalf would have sent Mr. Frodo on this errand if there hadn't a' been any hope of his ever coming back at all.\n",
      "Frodo was lying on his back with eyes open, staring at the cloudy sky.\n",
      "'Well, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'I've been having a look round and thinking a bit.\n",
      "'I can manage it,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Frodo seemed nearly spent.\n",
      "'I'm going back on to the road while the light lasts, Mr. Frodo,' he said.\n",
      "He was taking a far greater risk than he knew; but Frodo was too much occupied with his burden and with the struggle in his mind to debate, and almost too hopeless to care.\n",
      "All this last day Frodo had not spoken, but had walked half-bowed, often stumbling, as if his eyes no longer saw the way before his feet.\n",
      "Now as the blackness of night returned Frodo sat, his head between his knees, his arms hanging wearily to the ground where his hands lay feebly twitching.\n",
      "'Frodo!\n",
      "The light sprang up again, and there on the brink of the chasm, at the very Crack of Doom, stood Frodo, black against the glare, tense, erect, but still as if he had been turned to stone.\n",
      "Then Frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice, indeed with a voice clearer and more powerful than Sam had ever heard him use, and it rose above the throb and turmoil of Mount Doom, ringing in the roof and walls.\n",
      "And far away, as Frodo put on the Ring and claimed it for his own, even in Sammath Naur the very heart of his realm, the Power in Barad-dûr was shaken, and the Tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter crown.\n",
      "Frodo gave a cry, and there he was, fallen upon his knees at the chasm's edge.\n",
      "Sam ran to Frodo and picked him up and carried him.\n",
      "And there was Frodo, pale and worn, and yet himself again; and in his eyes there was peace now, neither strain of will, nor madness, nor any fear.\n",
      "'Yes,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'But do you remember Gandalf's words: _Even Gollum may have something yet to do?_ But for him, Sam, I could not have destroyed the Ring.\n",
      "Upon the hill-top stood Gandalf, and he was white and cold and no shadow fell on him.\n",
      "As if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given, Gandalf stirred; and he turned, looking back north where the skies were pale and clear.\n",
      "But Gandalf lifted up his arms and called once more in a clear voice:\n",
      "     'Stand, Men of the West!\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "Then Gandalf, leaving all such matters of battle and command to Aragorn and the other lords, stood upon the hill-top and called; and down to him came the great eagle, Gwaihir the Windlord, and stood before him.\n",
      "'Twice you have borne me, Gwaihir my friend,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "And he lifted up Gandalf and sped away south, and with him went Landroval, and Meneldor young and swift.\n",
      "'I am glad that you are here with me,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'Yes, I am with you, Master,' said Sam, laying Frodo's wounded hand gently to his breast.\n",
      "'Maybe not, Sam,' said Frodo; 'but it's like things are in the world.\n",
      "Come, Mr. Frodo, let's go down the path at any rate!'\n",
      "If you wish to go, I'll come,' said Frodo; and they rose and went slowly down the winding road; and even as they passed towards the Mountain's quaking feet, a great smoke and steam belched from the Sammath Naur, and the side of the cone was riven open, and a huge fiery vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain-side.\n",
      "Frodo and Sam could go no further.\n",
      "'What a tale we have been in, Mr. Frodo, haven't we?'\n",
      "Do you think they'll say: _Now comes the story of Nine-fingered Frodo and the Ring of Doom?_And then everyone will hush, like we did, when in Rivendell they told us the tale of Beren One-hand and the Great Jewel.\n",
      "He sat up and then he saw that Frodo was lying beside him, and slept peacefully, one hand behind his head, and the other resting upon the coverlet.\n",
      "With that Gandalf stood before him, robed in white, his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of the leafy sunlight.\n",
      "At last he gasped: 'Gandalf!\n",
      "'A great Shadow has departed,' said Gandalf, and then he laughed and the sound was like music, or like water in a parched land; and as he listened the thought came to Sam that he had not heard laughter, the pure sound of merriment, for days upon days without count.\n",
      "Frodo?'\n",
      "'Yes, I am all right otherwise,' said Frodo, sitting up and laughing in his turn.\n",
      "'The fourteenth of the New Year,' said Gandalf; 'or if you like, the eighth day of April in the Shire reckoning.\n",
      "'The King of Gondor and Lord of the Western Lands,' said Gandalf 'and he has taken back all his ancient realm.\n",
      "'The clothes that you wore on your way to Mordor,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Even the orc-rags that you bore in the black land; Frodo, shall be preserved.\n",
      "Frodo cried.\n",
      "The Lady Galadriel's gifts: your glass, Frodo, and your box, Sam.\n",
      "When they were washed and clad, and had eaten a light meal, the Hobbits followed Gandalf.\n",
      "     And so the red blood blushing in their faces and their eyes shining with wonder, Frodo and Sam went forward and saw that amidst the clamorous host were set three high-seats built of green turves.\n",
      "Frodo ran to meet him, and Sam followed close behind.\n",
      "And then to Sam's surprise and utter confusion he bowed his knee before them; and taking them by the hand, Frodo upon his right and Sam upon his left, he led them to the throne, and setting them upon it, he turned to the men and captains who stood by and spoke, so that his voice rang over all the host, crying:\n",
      "     'Praise them with great praise!'\n",
      "lords and knights and men of valour unashamed, kings and princes, and fair people of Gondor, and Riders of Rohan, and ye sons of Elrond, and Dúnedain of the North, and Elf and Dwarf, and greathearts of the Shire, and all free folk of the West, now listen to my lay.\n",
      "For I will sing to you of Frodo of the Nine Fingers and the Ring of Doom.'\n",
      "Frodo and Sam were led apart and brought to a tent, and there their old raiment was taken off, but folded and set aside with honour; and clean linen was given to them.\n",
      "Then Gandalf came and in his arms, to the wonder of Frodo, he bore the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had been taken from him in Mordor.\n",
      "'I do not wish for any sword,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'Tonight at least you should wear one,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Then Frodo took the small sword that had belonged to Sam, and had been laid at his side in Cirith Ungol.\n",
      "Frodo gave way; and Gandalf, as if he were their esquire, knelt and girt the sword-belts about them, and then rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads.\n",
      "And when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; and they sat at the King's table with Gandalf, and King Éomer of Rohan, and the Prince Imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were Gimli and Legolas.\n",
      "Then suddenly as they drew near and he could see them plainly, he exclaimed:\n",
      "     'Why, look Mr. Frodo!\n",
      "In the meantime you can try Gandalf.\n",
      "At last the glad day ended; and when the Sun was gone and the round Moon rode slowly above the mists of Anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves, Frodo and Sam sat under the whispering trees amid the fragrance of fair Ithilien; and they talked deep into the night with Merry and Pippin and Gandalf, and after a while Legolas and Gimli joined them.\n",
      "There Frodo and Sam learned much of all that had happened to the Company after their fellowship was broken on the evil day at Parth Galen by Rauros Falls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell.\n",
      "But amidst all these wonders he returned always to his astonishment at the size of Merry and Pippin; and he made them stand back to back with Frodo and himself.\n",
      "'And then Frodo will have to be locked up in a tower in Minas Tirith and write it all down.\n",
      "At length Gandalf rose.\n",
      "And not only Sam and Frodo here, said Gimli, but you too, Pippin.\n",
      "With him were Éomer of Rohan, and the Prince Imrahil, and Gandalf robed all in white, and four small figures that many men marvelled to see.\n",
      "Then Frodo came forward and took the crown from Faramir and bore it to Gandalf; and Aragorn knelt, and Gandalf set the White Crown upon his head, and said:\n",
      "     'Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!'\n",
      "     So the glad days passed; and on the eighth day of May the Riders of Rohan made ready, and rode off by the North-way, and with them went the sons of Elrond.\n",
      "In those days the Companions of the Ring dwelt together in a fair house with Gandalf, and they went to and fro as they wished.\n",
      "And Frodo said to Gandalf: 'Do you know what this day is that Aragorn speaks of?\n",
      "'As for Bilbo,' said Gandalf, 'he is waiting for the same day, and he knows what keeps you.\n",
      "'Pippin,' said Frodo, 'didn't you say that Gandalf was less close than of old?\n",
      "And Gandalf said: 'Many folk like to know beforehand what is to be set on the table; but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep their secret; for wonder makes the words of praise louder.\n",
      "First rode Elrohir and Elladan with a banner of silver, and then came Glorfindel and Erestor and all the household of Rivendell, and after them came the Lady Galadriel and Celeborn, Lord of Lothlórien, riding upon white steeds and with them many fair folk of their land, grey-cloaked with white gems in their hair; and last came Master Elrond, mighty among Elves and Men, bearing the sceptre of Annúminas, and beside him upon a grey palfrey rode Arwen his daughter, Evenstar of her people.\n",
      "And Frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening, with stars on her brow and a sweet fragrance about her, was moved with great wonder, and he said to Gandalf: 'At last I understand why we have waited!\n",
      "Then the King welcomed his guests, and they alighted; and Elrond surrendered the sceptre, and laid the hand of his daughter in the hand of the King, and together they went up into the High City, and all the stars flowered in the sky.\n",
      "For the other Companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and Frodo and Samwise rode at Aragorn's side, and Gandalf rode upon Shadowfax, and Pippin rode with the knights of Gondor; and Legolas and Gimli as ever rode together upon Arod.\n",
      "In that riding went also Queen Arwen, and Celeborn and Galadriel with their folk, and Elrond and his sons; and the princes of Dol Amroth and of Ithilien, and many captains and knights.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'You know the answers,' said Gandalf: 'no and no.\n",
      "'Then once more you are going the wrong way,' said Gandalf, 'and I see no hope in your journey.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "But Wormtongue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes full of terror at Gandalf, and then shuffled quickly past behind Saruman.\n",
      "'I would, if I had any,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'I'm sure it is,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'Yes, I think you had better do that,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "They had journeyed thus far by the west-ways, for they had much to speak of with Elrond and with Gandalf, and here they lingered still in converse with their friends.\n",
      "Frodo knew that Galadriel had held aloft her ring in token of farewell.\n",
      "At last one evening they came over the high moors, suddenly as to travellers it always seemed, to the brink of the deep valley of Rivendell and saw far below the lamps shining in Elrond's house.\n",
      "And they went down and crossed the bridge and came to the doors, and all the house was filled with light and song for joy at Elrond's homecoming.\n",
      "When nearly a fortnight had passed Frodo looked out of his window and saw that there had been a frost in the night, and the cobwebs were like white nets.\n",
      "Only the night before he had said:\n",
      "     'Well, Mr. Frodo, we've been far and seen a deal, and yet I don't think we've found a better place than this.\n",
      "'Yes, something of everything, Sam, except the Sea,' Frodo had answered; and he repeated it now to himself: 'Except the Sea.'\n",
      "That day Frodo spoke to Elrond, and it was agreed that they should leave the next morning.\n",
      "To their delight Gandalf said: 'I think I shall come too.\n",
      "Then he gave Frodo his mithril-coat and Sting, forgetting that he had already done so; and he gave him also three books of lore that he had made at various times, written in his spidery hand, and labelled on their red backs: _Translations from the Elvish, by B.B._\n",
      "     To Sam he gave a little bag of gold.\n",
      "Which reminds me: what's become of my ring, Frodo, that you took away?'\n",
      "'I have lost it, Bilbo dear,' said Frodo.\n",
      "I think Gandalf might have shown me round a bit.\n",
      "     The next day Gandalf and the hobbits took leave of Bilbo in his room, for it was cold out of doors; and then they said farewell to Elrond and all his household.\n",
      "As Frodo stood upon the threshold, Elrond wished him a fair journey, and blessed him, and he said:\n",
      "     'I think, Frodo, that maybe you will not need to come back, unless you come very soon.\n",
      "These words no one else heard, and Frodo kept them to himself.\n",
      "They were eager now to see the Shire again; but at first they rode only slowly, for Frodo had been ill at ease.\n",
      "'Are you in pain, Frodo?'\n",
      "said Gandalf quietly as he rode by Frodo's side.\n",
      "'Well, yes I am,' said Frodo.\n",
      "there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'I fear it may be so with mine,' said Frodo.\n",
      "Gandalf did not answer.\n",
      "By the end of the next day the pain and unease had passed, and Frodo was merry again, as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the day before.\n",
      "Then Frodo begged them to hasten, and he would not look towards the hill, but rode through its shadow with head bowed and cloak drawn close about him.\n",
      "He looked at them with fear and suspicion; but when he saw that Gandalf was there, and that his companions were hobbits, in spite of their strange gear, then he brightened and wished them welcome.\n",
      "'And there you'll hear later all that we say, and more,' laughed Gandalf.\n",
      "But I'm right glad to see you, and none more than Gandalf.\n",
      "And you'll be taking your horse to his stable yourself Gandalf; I don't doubt.\n",
      "'That is just what we should like, too,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "They put him in a large chair by the wood-fire, and Gandalf sat on the other side of the hearth, and the hobbits in low chairs between them; and then they talked for many times half an hour, and exchanged all such news as Mr. Butterbur wished to hear or give.\n",
      "You don't say, Master Gandalf!\n",
      "'I will indeed,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "And Gandalf, too, was now riding on his tall grey horse, all clad in white with a great mantle of blue and silver over all, and the long sword Glamdring at his side.\n",
      "Gandalf laughed.\n",
      "'I expect it has,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'You will be let alone, Barliman,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'The Rangers go there,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'He will,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Not but what my beer's good, Gandalf.\n",
      "'Better times, for Bree at any rate,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Bree memories being retentive, Frodo was asked many times if he had written his book.\n",
      "The Bree folk were all out to see them off, and were in merrier mood than they had been for a year; and those who had not seen the strangers in all their gear before gaped with wonder at them: at Gandalf with his white beard, and the light that seemed to gleam from him, as if his blue mantle was only a cloud over sunshine; and at the four hobbits like riders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales.\n",
      "'I wonder what old Barliman was hinting at,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'Deep in, but not at the bottom,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'I am with you at present,' said Gandalf, 'but soon I shall not be.\n",
      "They halted and Frodo looked south wistfully.\n",
      "'As well as ever, you may be sure,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'There weren't any gates, you mean,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "He turned Shadowfax off the Road, and the great horse leaped the green dike that here ran beside it; and then at a cry from Gandalf he was gone, racing towards the Barrow-downs like a wind from the North.\n",
      "Frodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief part had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses, from slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons.\n",
      "They ate a late midday meal, and then Frodo said with a sigh: 'Well, I suppose it is time now that we dealt with the \"Chief\".'\n",
      "Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin led the way.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "At the top of the lane the party halted, and Frodo and his friends went on; and they came at last to the once beloved place.\n",
      "'Yes, this is Mordor,' said Frodo.\n",
      "A sudden light broke on Frodo.\n",
      "'I did not,' said Frodo.\n",
      "A little mischief in a mean way: Gandalf warned me that you were still capable of it.\n",
      "Gandalf would look after your affairs.'\n",
      "'Well, if that is what you find pleasure in,' said Frodo, 'I pity you.\n",
      "When they heard Frodo's command, they murmured angrily:\n",
      "     'Don't let him go!\n",
      "But Frodo said: 'Do not believe him!\n",
      "But even as Saruman passed close to Frodo a knife flashed in his hand, and he stabbed swiftly.\n",
      "said Frodo.\n",
      "Saruman rose to his feet, and stared at Frodo.\n",
      "called Frodo.\n",
      "Before Frodo could recover or speak a word, three hobbit-bows twanged and Wormtongue fell dead.\n",
      "Frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he looked it seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it, and it shrank, and the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull.\n",
      "'I hope so,' said Frodo and sighed.\n",
      "     Frodo and Sam halted and sat silent in the soft shadows, until they saw a shimmer as the travellers came towards them.\n",
      "There was Gildor and many fair Elven folk; and there to Sam's wonder rode Elrond and Galadriel.\n",
      "Elrond wore a mantle of grey and had a star upon his forehead, and a silver harp was in his hand, and upon his finger was a ring of gold with a great blue stone, Vilya, mightiest of the Three.\n",
      "Elrond greeted them gravely and graciously, and Galadriel smiled upon them.\n",
      "'Hullo, Frodo!'\n",
      "'Yes, I am coming,' said Frodo.\n",
      "'To the Havens, Sam,' said Frodo.\n",
      "And also you have Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo-lad will come, and Rosie-lass, and Merry, and Goldilocks, and Pippin; and perhaps more that I cannot see.\n",
      "Then Elrond and Galadriel rode on; for the Third Age was over, and the Days of the Rings were passed, and an end was come of the story and song of those times.\n",
      "With them went many Elves of the High Kindred who would no longer stay in Middle-earth; and among them, filled with a sadness that was yet blessed and without bitterness, rode Sam, and Frodo, and Bilbo, and the Elves delighted to honour them.\n",
      "As he turned and came towards them Frodo saw that Gandalf now wore openly upon his hand the Third Ring, Narya the Great, and the stone upon it was red as fire.\n",
      "Then those who were to go were glad, for they knew that Gandalf also would take ship with them.\n",
      "'You tried to give us the slip once before and failed, Frodo.'\n",
      "It was not Sam, though, that gave you away this time, but Gandalf himself!'\n",
      "'Yes,' said Gandalf; 'for it will be better to ride back three together 'than one alone.\n",
      "Then Frodo kissed Merry and Pippin, and last of all Sam, and went aboard; and the sails were drawn up, and the wind blew, and slowly the ship slipped away down the long grey firth; and the light of the glass of Galadriel that Frodo bore glimmered and was lost.\n",
      "And the ship went out into the High Sea and passed on into the West, until at last on a night of rain Frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water.\n"

      "'Rivendell!'\n",
      "'Very good: I will go east, and I will make for Rivendell.\n",
      "'It is,' said Frodo; 'but I thought my going was a secret known only to Gandalf and my faithful Sam.'\n",
      "'Has Gandalf told you nothing?'\n",
      "My plan was to leave the Shire secretly, and make my way to Rivendell; but now my footsteps are dogged, before ever I get to Buckland.'\n",
      "But if you desire clearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf.\n",
      "These things Gandalf must know.\n",
      "I have been expecting Gandalf for many days.\n",
      "'That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well.\n",
      "I think you should now go at once, without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go alone.\n",
      "If I take your advice I may not see Gandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the danger that pursues me.'\n",
      "If I had got this at once, we might all have been safe in Rivendell by now.\n",
      "But what can have happened to Gandalf?\n",
      "Frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf's second postscript.\n",
      "'Why didn't you tell me that you were Gandalf's friend at once?'\n",
      "'They are – at first sight at any rate,' laughed Pippin with sudden relief after reading Gandalf's letter.\n",
      "'How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about?'\n",
      "'You never mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out.\n",
      "But how did you know that they were in Gandalf's letter, if you have never seen it?'\n",
      "'It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way from here to Rivendell.\n",
      "Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us.\n",
      "'When did you last see Gandalf?'\n",
      "He told me that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for Rivendell in the last week of September.\n",
      "The tidings had gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen.\n",
      "'Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it – with Gandalf's absence, I mean?'\n",
      "Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know – as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys.\n",
      "If Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him.\n",
      "And no sign of Gandalf.\n",
      "'It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure.\n",

      "     'I should say,' answered Strider, 'that they stood for G3, and were a sign that Gandalf was here on October the third: that is three days ago now.\n",
      "He is here no longer, and we must now look after ourselves and make our own way to Rivendell, as best we can '\n",
      "     'How far is Rivendell?'\n",
      "But I know how long it would take me on my own feet, with fair weather and no ill fortune twelve days from here to the Ford of Bruinen, where the Road crosses the Loudwater that runs out of Rivendell.\n",
      "Elrond of Rivendell is of that Kin.\n",
      "He did not forget the Barrow, nor the message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to yield.\n",
      "Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so.\n",
      "If Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not return.\n",
      "It flows down out of the Ettenmoors, the troll-fells north of Rivendell, and joins the Loudwater away in the South.\n",
      "'That is Loudwater, the Bruinen of Rivendell,' answered Strider.\n",
      "'The heirs of Elendil do not forget all things past,' said Strider; 'and many more things than I can tell are remembered in Rivendell.'\n",
      "'Have you often been to Rivendell?'\n",
      "If we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the Ettendales far north of Rivendell.\n",
      "We could perhaps find our way through and come round to Rivendell from the north; but it would take too long, for I do not know the way, and our food would not last.\n",
      "Do you think they will be able to cure him in Rivendell, if we ever get there?'\n",
      "These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf, quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.'\n",
      "'I was sent from Rivendell to look for you.\n",
      "'Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?'\n",
      "They said that the Nine were abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance, for Gandalf had not returned.\n",
      "There are few even in Rivendell that can ride openly against the Nine; but such as there were, Elrond sent out north, west, and south.\n",
      "'I shall not ride him, if I am to be carried off to Rivendell or anywhere else, leaving my friends behind in danger.'\n",
      "`Gandalf!'\n",
      "While he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft puffs of Gandalf's pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out of the window.\n",
      "'Yes, they are all safe and sound,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "You were beginning to fade,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "'You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo,' said Gandalf gently, 'and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory.\n",
      "'I was delayed,' said Gandalf, `and that nearly proved our ruin.\n",
      "'You will soon hear all you wish to know,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Yes, I, Gandalf the Grey,' said the wizard solemnly.\n",
      "Gandalf smiled.\n",
      "`You don't know much even about them, if you think old Barliman is stupid,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "cried Gandalf.\n",
      "They have helped me before; and I shall need their help in the days to come; for we have reached Rivendell, but the Ring is not yet at rest.'\n",
      "'You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,' said Gandalf, `not to mention courage.\n",
      "`What about Rivendell and the Elves?\n",
      "Is Rivendell safe?'\n",
      "And here in Rivendell there live still some of his chief foes: the Elven-wise, lords of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas.\n",
      "Indeed there is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might of Mordor, for a while: and elsewhere other powers still dwell.\n",
      "You are in Rivendell, and you need not worry about anything for the present.'\n",
      "Gandalf moved his chair to the bedside, and took a good look at Frodo.\n",
      "`Still that must be expected,' said Gandalf to himself.\n",
      "'No,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Elrond's folk met them, carrying you slowly towards Rivendell.'\n",
      "'Elrond commanded it,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo, but he had shut his eyes.\n",
      "`Well, there are many reasons why they should,' said Gandalf, smiling.\n",
      "Elrond, as was his custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left, Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were revealed as lords of dignity and power.\n",
      "Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend.\n",
      "He was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men.\n",
      "Long she had been in the land of her mother's kin, in Lórien beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her father's house.\n",
      "But perhaps I should not inquire too closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?'\n",
      "'lndeed,' said Glóin, `if it were not for the Beornings, the passage from Dale to Rivendell would long ago have become impossible.\n",
      "'It is largely on account of Balin that I have come to ask the advice of those that dwell in Rivendell.\n",
      "Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf.\n",
      "Frodo wondered whether he was ill (if people were ever ill in Rivendell), and had been unable to come to the feast.\n",
      "When he had left Hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly, along the Road or in the country on either side; but somehow he had steered all the time towards Rivendell.\n",
      "They sing them occasionally: just to please me, I think; for, of course, they aren't really good enough for Rivendell.\n",
      "Gandalf has been here often.\n",
      "It is a pity that Gandalf did not find out more sooner.\n",
      "I have thought several times of going back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they would not let me: Gandalf and Elrond, I mean.\n",
      "'And Gandalf said: \"The Ring has passed on, Bilbo.\n",
      "Odd sort of remark, just like Gandalf.\n",
      "On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk.\n",
      "He pointed away far up the side of Rivendell to the north.\n",
      "'You may have a chance later,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "`That is the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,' cried Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the evening before.\n",
      "`Here,' said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, `is Boromir, a man from the South.\n",
      "One of these was Ohtar, the esquire of Isildur, who bore the shards of the sword of Elendil; and he brought them to Valandil, the heir of Isildur, who being but a child had remained here in Rivendell.\n",
      "` \"So you have come, Gandalf,\" he said to me gravely; but in his eyes there seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart.\n",
      "\"Have you indeed, Gandalf the _Grey_! \"\n",
      "It has seldom been heard of that Gandalf the Grey sought for aid, one so cunning and so wise, wandering about the lands, and concerning himself in every business, whether it belongs to him or not.\"\n",
      "And here you will stay, Gandalf the Grey, and rest from journeys.\n",
      "\"And listen, Gandalf, my old friend and helper! \"\n",
      "It would be wise, Gandalf.\n",
      "\"And why not, Gandalf? \"\n",
      "Or until it is found in your despite, and the Ruler has time to turn to lighter matters: to devise, say, a fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey.\"\n",
      "I hoped that Frodo had set forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached Rivendell before the deadly pursuit began.\n",
      "Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him.\n",
      "`Then it was late in coming,' said Gandalf, 'as you will see.\n",
      "Gandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spider's treacherous web!\n",
      "And the Eagles of the Mountains went far and wide, and they saw many things: the gathering of wolves and the mustering of Orcs; and the Nine Riders going hither and thither in the lands; and they heard news of the escape of Gollum.\n",
      "`So it was that when summer waned, there came a night of moon, and Gwaihir the Windlord, swiftest of the Great Eagles, came unlooked-for to Orthanc; and he found me standing on the pinnacle.\n",
      "But I hoped to draw some of them off, and yet reach Rivendell ahead of you and send out help.\n",
      "But so it was that I came to Rivendell only three days before the Ring, and news of its peril had already been brought here-which proved well indeed.\n",
      "But such a thing has not happened before, that Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised.\n",
      "If you have to go, then it will be a punishment for any of us to be left behind, even in Rivendell.\n",
      "said Gandalf, looking in through the window, which was near the ground.\n",
      "Even old Gandalf.\n",
      "`You were wrong,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Have they started yet, Gandalf?'\n",
      "'I am afraid it will,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "So great was Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the window-sill, where he had been sitting, and took off his hat and bowed.\n",
      "said Frodo to Bilbo when Gandalf had gone.\n",
      "I can't count days in Rivendell,' said Bilbo.\n",
      "For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey and of the perils that lay ahead; but such was the virtue of the land of Rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds.\n",
      "Even from the Eagles of the Misty Mountains they had learned no fresh news.\n",
      "'Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Of course the Enemy has other servants, but they will have to journey all the way to the borders of Rivendell before they can pick up our trail.\n",
      "With you and your faithful servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, and maybe the end of his labours.\n",
      "`Neither does Frodo,' said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin.\n",
      "Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond.\n",
      "They were to start at dusk, for Elrond counselled them to journey under cover of night as often as they could, until they were far from Rivendell.\n",
      "Putting it to his lips he blew a blast, and the echoes leapt from rock to rock, and all that heard that voice in Rivendell sprang to their feet.\n",
      "Gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring, the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely Mountain.\n",
      "?he stay in Rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on him: he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth.\n",
      "Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they were only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house.\n",
      "     At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called the Company to him.\n",
      "They crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of Rivendell; and they came at length to the high moor where the wind hissed through the heather.\n",
      "`This will be the death of the halflings, Gandalf,' said Boromir.\n",
      "`Give them this,' said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a leathern flask.\n",
      "'The choice seems near now between fire and death, Gandalf.\n",
      "'You may make a fire, if you can,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "At last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand.\n",
      "'I have written _Gandalf is here_ in signs that all can read from Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.'\n",
      "Gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of Rivendell.\n",
      "'We still have our journey and our errand before us,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "`We have no choice but to go on, or to return to Rivendell.'\n",
      "Pippin's face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to Rivendell; Merry and Sam looked up hopefully.\n",
      "`You are right, Frodo,' said Gandalf: `to go back is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come.\n",
      "Then sooner or later Rivendell will be besieged, and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed.\n",
      "`There is a way that we may attempt,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "`You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to the stronghold of Sauron,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "The Eagles report that Orcs are gathering again from afar; but there is a hope that Moria is still free.\n",
      "'I will tread the path with you, Gandalf! '\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "It is not of the Ring, nor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf.\n",
      "`I do not wish to go,' he said; `but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "`There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,' answered Gandalf grimly.\n",
      "Whatever may be in store for old Gandalf, I'll wager it isn't a wolf's belly.'\n",
      "Gandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft.\n",
      "`Gandalf is here.\n",
      "Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting packs had fled.\n",
      "cried Gandalf to the hobbits.\n",
      "In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill.\n",
      "`It is as I feared,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "`We must reach the doors before sunset,' said Gandalf, 'or I fear we shall not reach them at all.\n",
      "`I do not know which to hope,' said Boromir grimly: `that Gandalf will find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for ever.\n",
      "But either Gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in recent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it, only a few miles southwards from their start.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly up them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo.\n",
      "`There are the Walls of Moria,' said Gandalf, pointing across the water.\n",
      "`But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "`I am sorry,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was making for; and then he had still to find the doors.\n",
      "Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as quickly as they could.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'I have heard both,' said Gandalf; 'and I will not give judgement now.\n",
      "'But you can't leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place, Mr. Gandalf! '\n",
      "'It will be short of murder, I hope,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "`You are a wise beast, and have learned much in Rivendell.\n",
      "When this was done they turned to watch Gandalf.\n",
      "'But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,' said Gandalf, coming suddenly to life and turning round.\n",
      "Again Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath.\n",
      "'Why doesn't Gandalf do something quick? '\n",
      "Gandalf took no notice of them.\n",
      "`I was wrong after all,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli too.\n",
      "shouted Gandalf leaping back.\n",
      "Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff-wall and the doors.\n",
      "Gandalf turned and paused.\n",
      "They heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors.\n",
      "'I do not know,' answered Gandalf, 'but the arms were all guided by one purpose.\n",
      "'I will,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli shall walk with me.\n",
      "After they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell.\n",
      "'I cannot say,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf walked in front as before.\n",
      "Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage.\n",
      "Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word.\n",
      "To Gandalf the far-off memories of a journey long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal.\n",
      "There was a pause longer than usual, and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together; the others were crowded behind, waiting anxiously.\n",
      "I have been with him on many a journey, if never on one so dark; and there are tales of Rivendell of greater deeds of his than any that I have seen.\n",
      "Though he had been healed in Rivendell of the knife-stroke, that grim wound had not been without effect.\n",
      "One sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf.\n",
      "They had been going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came to his first serious check.\n",
      "said Gandalf, standing uncertainly under the arch.\n",
      "cried Gandalf as Merry and Pippin pushed forward, glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the open passage.\n",
      "cried Gandalf.\n",
      "`Yes,' said Gandalf, 'and I do not like it.\n",
      "He wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep.\n",
      "Actually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent.\n",
      "It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep.\n",
      "Gandalf seemed pleased.\n",
      "`That is all that I shall venture on for the present,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'For _mithril_,' answered Gandalf.\n",
      "'Yes,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "But now his thoughts had been carried away from the dark Mines, to Rivendell, to Bilbo, and to Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still there.\n",
      "said Gandalf: `For morning it is again at last.\n",
      "After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once.\n",
      "'Maybe,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Gandalf came quickly to his side.\n",
      "`Farewell, Gandalf! '\n",
      "For I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose, and first I hope to come to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the Great River-out yonder.'\n",
      "Is this the coat that Gandalf spoke of?\n",
      "It is a fair song in our woodland tongue; but this is how it runs in the Westron Speech, as some in Rivendell now sing it.'\n",
      "`Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company, but he did not pass the borders of this land.\n",
      "`Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow.\n",
      "'Gandalf was our guide, and he led us through Moria; and when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.'\n",
      "And if it were possible, one would say that at the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net of Moria.'\n",
      "`Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.\n",
      "Yet not in vain will it prove, maybe, that you came to this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed.\n",
      "And if my designs had not gone amiss, it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey, and then mayhap things would have gone otherwise.\n",
      "But tonight I shall sleep without fear for the first time since I left Rivendell.\n",
      "Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds.\n",
      "He was seldom moved to make song or rhyme; even in Rivendell he had listened and had not sung himself, though his memory was stored with many things that others had made before him.\n",
      "No fireworks like poor Gandalf used to show.\n",
      "And I don't miss Gandalf's fireworks, but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.'\n",
      "It's when we leave this land that we shall miss Gandalf worse, I'm thinking.'\n",
      "Suddenly Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf.\n",
      "Doubt came into Frodo's mind: was this a vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it Saruman?\n",
      "`I would ask one thing before we go,' said Frodo, `a thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell.\n",
      "Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each possessor?\n",
      "I am not Gandalf, and though I have tried to bear his part, I do not know what design or hope he had for this hour, if indeed he had any.\n",
      "All that had happened since Bilbo left the Shire was passing through his mind, and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of Gandalf's words.\n",
      "'Gandalf, Elrond – all these folk have taught you to say so.\n",
      "Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.'\n",
      "It seemed different so far away, in the Shire or in Rivendell.\n",
      "It will be hard news for Frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in Rivendell.\n",
      "'But Gandalf was not,' said Legolas.\n",
      "'But Gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost ' answered Gimli.\n",
      "'The counsel of Gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for himself or for others,' said Aragorn.\n",
      "He wished now that he had learned more in Rivendell, and looked more at maps and things; but in those days the plans for the journey seemed to be in more competent hands, and he had never reckoned with being cut off from Gandalf, or from Strider, and even from Frodo.\n",
      "All that he could remember about Rohan was that Gandalf's horse, Shadowfax, had come from that land.\n",
      "He was immensely interested in everything: in the Black Riders, in Elrond, and Rivendell, in the Old Forest, and Tom Bombadil, in the Mines of Moria, and in Lothlórien and Galadriel.\n",
      "Treebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned Gandalf; and most interested of all in Saruman's doings.\n",
      "The hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little about them: only a rather vague report by Sam of what Gandalf had told the Council.\n",
      "But I do not doubt that you are doing as Gandalf would wish.\n",
      "By root and twig, but it is a strange business: up sprout a little folk that are not in the old lists, and behold the Nine forgotten Riders reappear to hunt them, and Gandalf takes them on a great journey, and Galadriel harbours them in Caras Galadhon, and Orcs pursue them down all the leagues of Wilderland: indeed they seem to be caught up in a great storm.\n",
      "'No, I did not find them,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'There was a darkness over the valleys of the Emyn Muil, and I did not know of their captivity, until the eagle told me.'\n",
      "'The eagle!'\n",
      "'I have seen an eagle high and far off: the last time was three days ago, above the Emyn Muil.'\n",
      "'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'that was Gwaihir the Windlord, who rescued me from Orthanc.\n",
      "The Ring now has passed beyond my help, or the help of any of the Company that set out from Rivendell.\n",
      "said Gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face.\n",
      "For a long while Gandalf said nothing, and he asked no questions.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "said Gandalf, and paused for a while in thought.\n",
      "He knows now the number of our Company that set out from Rivendell, and the kind of each of us.\n",
      "'Indeed yes,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'The victor would emerge stronger than either, and free from doubt,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'One that you cannot slay with arrows,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Was it you, Gandalf, or Saruman that we saw last night?'\n",
      "'You certainly did not see me,' answered Gandalf, 'therefore I must guess that you saw Saruman.\n",
      "Gandalf laughed again.\n",
      "'With Treebeard and the Ents,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "now you are asking much,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "cried Gandalf.\n",
      "'I do not know,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "Time presses,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Certainly,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "'Nor will you again,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "As soon as Shadowfax saw Gandalf, he checked his pace and whinnied loudly; then trotting gently forward he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the old man's neck.\n",
      "Gandalf caressed him.\n",
      "'It is a long way from Rivendell, my friend,' he said; 'but you are wise and swift and come at need.\n",
      "'We go at once to Meduseld, the hall of your master, Théoden,' said Gandalf, addressing them gravely.\n",
      "Did you know that he was at hand, Gandalf?'\n",
      "And then for a little while we can pretend that we are all back safe at Bree again, or in Rivendell.'\n",
      "'We will sit on the edge of ruin and talk, as Gandalf says, while he is busy elsewhere.\n",
      "'Well, Rivendell then,' said Merry.\n",
      "'You were riding with Gandalf.'\n",
      "Remember Saruman was once Gandalf's superior: head of the Council, whatever that may be exactly.\n",
      "Gandalf is the White now.\n",
      "'Well, if Gandalf has changed at all, then he's closer than ever that's all,' Pippin argued.\n",
      "I know I can't have it, with old Gandalf sitting on it, like a hen on an egg.\n",
      "On your journey from Rivendell there must have been many things to tell.\n",
      "with the wolves of the wild, in the snows under Caradhras, and in the mines of Moria where Gandalf fell.\n",
      "He alone knew the way after Gandalf's fall.\n",
      "`I wish old Gandalf was hare or somebody.\n",
      "And that's the end of all of us, of Lorien, and Rivendell, and the Shire and all.\n",
      "     Gandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of Shadowfax were lost in the night, when Merry came back to Aragorn.\n",
      "'It is a gift that I bring you from the Lady of Rivendell,' answered Halbarad.\n",
      "Less sombre is their gear than the others', and they are fair and gallant as Elven-lords; and that is not to be wondered at in the sons of Elrond of Rivendell.'\n",
      "'Word came to Rivendell, they say: _Aragorn has need of his kindred.\n",
      "Gandalf sent it, I would guess.'\n",
      "'Did she not speak through Gandalf of the ride of the Grey Company from the North?'\n",
      "Even Gandalf feared that encounter.'\n",
      "This is the word that the sons of Elrond bring to me from their father in Rivendell, wisest in lore: _Bid Aragorn remember the words of the seer, and the Paths of the Dead_.'\n",
      "Upon the hill-top stood Gandalf, and he was white and cold and no shadow fell on him.\n",
      "As if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given, Gandalf stirred; and he turned, looking back north where the skies were pale and clear.\n",
      "Then he lifted up his hands and cried in a loud voice ringing above the din: _The Eagles are coming!_ And many voices answered crying: _The Eagles are coming!\n",
      "The Eagles are coming!_ The hosts of Mordor looked up and wondered what this sign might mean.\n",
      "There came Gwaihir the Windlord, and Landroval his brother, greatest of all the Eagles of the North, mightiest of the descendants of old Thorondor, who built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the Encircling Mountains when Middle-earth was young.\n",
      "But Gandalf lifted up his arms and called once more in a clear voice:\n",
      "     'Stand, Men of the West!\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "Then Gandalf, leaving all such matters of battle and command to Aragorn and the other lords, stood upon the hill-top and called; and down to him came the great eagle, Gwaihir the Windlord, and stood before him.\n",
      "'Twice you have borne me, Gwaihir my friend,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "And he lifted up Gandalf and sped away south, and with him went Landroval, and Meneldor young and swift.\n",
      "Do you think they'll say: _Now comes the story of Nine-fingered Frodo and the Ring of Doom?_And then everyone will hush, like we did, when in Rivendell they told us the tale of Beren One-hand and the Great Jewel.\n",
      "First rode Elrohir and Elladan with a banner of silver, and then came Glorfindel and Erestor and all the household of Rivendell, and after them came the Lady Galadriel and Celeborn, Lord of Lothlórien, riding upon white steeds and with them many fair folk of their land, grey-cloaked with white gems in their hair; and last came Master Elrond, mighty among Elves and Men, bearing the sceptre of Annúminas, and beside him upon a grey palfrey rode Arwen his daughter, Evenstar of her people.\n",
      "And Frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening, with stars on her brow and a sweet fragrance about her, was moved with great wonder, and he said to Gandalf: 'At last I understand why we have waited!\n",
      "Aragorn and his knights, and the people of Lórien and of Rivendell, made ready to ride; but Faramir and Imrahil remained at Edoras; and Arwen Evenstar remained also, and she said farewell to her brethren.\n",
      "Then Treebeard praised all their deeds, of which he seemed to have full knowledge; and at last he stopped and looked long at Gandalf.\n",
      "'To see how your work goes, my friend,' said Gandalf, 'and to thank you for your aid in all that has been achieved.'\n",
      "'The New Age begins,' said Gandalf, 'and in this age it may well prove that the kingdoms of Men shall outlast you, Fangorn my friend.\n",
      "Treebeard gave Gandalf a long look, a most cunning look, Merry thought.\n",
      "asked Gandalf.\n",
      "'I observe, my good Fangorn,' said Gandalf, 'that with great care you say _dwelt_, _was_, _grew_.\n",
      "Now do not tell me, Gandalf, that I promised to keep him safe; for I know it.\n",
      "'You may be right,' said Gandalf; 'but this snake had still one tooth left, I think.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "'You know the answers,' said Gandalf: 'no and no.\n",
      "'Then once more you are going the wrong way,' said Gandalf, 'and I see no hope in your journey.\n",
      "said Gandalf.\n",
      "But Wormtongue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes full of terror at Gandalf, and then shuffled quickly past behind Saruman.\n",
      "I am going to Rivendell first, whatever happens.'\n",
      "'Yes, I think you had better do that,' said Gandalf.\n",
      "They had journeyed thus far by the west-ways, for they had much to speak of with Elrond and with Gandalf, and here they lingered still in converse with their friends.\n",
      "Quickly fading into the stones and the shadows the grey-cloaked people of Lórien rode towards the mountains; and those who were going to Rivendell sat on the hill and watched, until there came out of the gathering mist a flash; and then they saw no more.\n",
      "At last one evening they came over the high moors, suddenly as to travellers it always seemed, to the brink of the deep valley of Rivendell and saw far below the lamps shining in Elrond's house.\n",
      "After the celebration of Bilbo's birthday the four hobbits stayed in Rivendell for some days, and they sat much with their old friend, who spent most of his time now in his room, except at meals.\n",
      "To their delight Gandalf said: 'I think I shall come too.\n",
      "I think Gandalf might have shown me round a bit.\n"
